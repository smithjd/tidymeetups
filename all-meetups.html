<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Trails-Club-of-Oregon">Trails Club of Oregon</a></h2>for: <b>1434</b> Members<br><p>An enthusiastic group dedicated to enjoying and preserving the great outdoors. We sponsor year-round hikes, backpacks, rambles, cycling trips and other recreational activities for a variety of performance levels.</p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Endorphin-Drip-Hiking-and-Cycling-Club-of-Portland">Endorphin Drip Hiking and Cycling Club of Portland</a></h2>for: <b>1335</b> Endorphin Drippers<br><p>Why did I choose Endorphin Drip Hiking and Cycling Club as the name for this group? Endorphins function as neurotransmitters in the brain and are produced during exercise, pain, excitement, and orgasm. I can only guarantee the first three. Endorphins resemble opiates in their ability to produce pain relief and feelings of well-being and the effect has often been referred to as a runner's high but the effect can occur anytime that people engage in any strenuous exercise or activity, not just running.</p>
<p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/3/e/event_286539742.jpeg"></p>
<p>Does Portland need another hiking&nbsp;club? I don't know the answer to that but what I do know is that I&nbsp;go on&nbsp;a lot of hikes and rides by myself because there is often nothing else available that fits my schedule, my fitness level, or my idea of a good time,&nbsp;so what I'm going to do is schedule hikes and rides that appeal to me and then toss them out into this meetup world to see if anybody else wants to join in.</p>
<p>The events&nbsp;that I lead will tend to be long but moderate in pace. I don't race up the hills. I go at a speed that still allows for plenty of chatter and anybody that knows me knows that chatter is important and we always have time to stop for photos.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;my hikes can, on occasion,&nbsp;burst out in a bout of 420 friendliness.&nbsp;If you have ideas for some&nbsp;hikes or rides you would like to do, let us know and we will&nbsp;schedule them in.&nbsp; If you would like to lead some&nbsp;hikes of your own within the&nbsp;group&nbsp;then that can be arranged also.</p>
<p>Not only are we a club, we are a community. &nbsp;That means we are here to encourage and support each other.&nbsp; Nobody is left behind.</p>
<p>I'll always try to accurately describe the difficulty level of each hike or ride in hopes that people will choose events that best fit their abilities.</p>
<p>I am not a professional hiking/cycling guide and my personal fitness trainer certification expired a long time ago so I must insist that all participants&nbsp;be responsible for their own safety and well-being. Hope to see you on the trails and bike paths!</p></hr> </html>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/9BridgesPDX">9 Bridges - PDX</a></h2>for: <b>1180</b> Writers<br><p><span><strong>Welcome to 9 Bridges</strong></span></p>
<p>Writing can be a solitary journey. There is no one right or wrong way to pursue your love of writing, and no two writers share the exact same experiences. The methodology that works for one person often doesnt work for another. Writers are a little like stars in the sky  while there are countless numbers, each is completely unique and capable of creating their own world full of wonder.</p>
<p>9 Bridges creates connections  bridging differences in styles, personalities and level of experience. We feel we can all learn from one another, whether it means a poet might learn something new about cadence from a science fiction writer, or that a horror writer might coach a memoir writer about tension. We strive to not only connect writers to writers, but to give writers greater access to the communities that can help them the best.</p>
<p>We do this through offering positive, supportive critique groups that help people improve their writing skills without cutting them down. The format is simple - each member brings a sample of their current work in progress and reads it out loud to the group. Feedback is based on based on what is heard, and this provides a different experience than seeing things on paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have monthly workshops on a variety of topics about the craft and business of writing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we partner with other organizations to bring discounts and/or free admissions to members for conferences, events and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Membership is free. We keep this organization up and running through the generous support of our members. Please consider assisting us - we are an Oregon-based 501(c)3 non-profit and your donation is tax-deductible.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span> <br> <strong>Keep Writing!!!!!!!</strong></span></p></hr> </html>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Portland-Metro-Veggies">Portland Metro Veggies</a></h2>for: <b>874</b> Veggies<br><p>This Meetup is for vegans, vegetarians and the veg-curious. We come from all over the greater Portland metro area, East, West, North and South. We do not promote any one political party or religious agenda, nor do we sell anything or recruit for other Meetups. Our group is open to singles, couples, and families of all kinds. We're here for fun, socializing and making new like-minded friends.</p>
<br>
<p>In the past, we've posted volunteer events, outdoor events, movies, concerts, plays and author readings. We've had hikes and bike rides, done garden walks, played air hockey at arcades, etc. -- often (but not always) with a veggie meal before or after for those interested. Many of us support animal rights, environmental and human rights issues. If you have other ideas, just ask Mathew or Susan to help us plan events!</p>
<p>Read More:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Metro-Veggies/about/">http://www.meetup.com/Portland-Metro-Veggies/about/</a></p>
<p><b>Q: What is our main purpose?</b></p>
<p>A: To join fellow vegans/vegetarians for meals, chat, fun, and anything else under the sun! Or, to be more accurate, under the rain clouds much of the year in the Pacific Northwest. We're NOT centered around political activism, but we're more of a laid-back social group. Our group is for meeting people and doing fun activities in the Portland Metro area.</p>
<p><br><b>Q: How do I join?</b></p>
<p>A: You must have a photo of yourself in order to join. We are primarily a social group and it makes it easier to identify people when we do events. It also makes it more comfortable to invite people to your home for a potluck if you can see who is attending. Do be aware that we reserve the right to not admit new members with inappropriate photos or nicknames.<br></p></hr> </html>

</ul>
<p><span style="color : #008000"><strong><span style="font-size : medium">This Meetup group is just for you.<br>

</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color : #000000 ; font-size : small">We're a group of fans of live music of any kind that want to see great shows, meet new people, and support live music venues around Portland. At each posted event there will be an Event Host to coordinate the details for where/when to meet and to provide all RSVPs a contact for any questions before, during or after the event.<br>

<p>The goal of <strong>Les Femmes PDX</strong> is to intentionally build a cohesive, harmonious, safe, thriving, happy, healthy <strong>community</strong> for Portland area lesbians on the feminine side of the scale who want to spend time with other femme lesbians for friendship, fun and... we'll leave it at that. :)</p>
<p><span>If you're new to Portland or you've been here a while, welcome! If you're just out of a relationship and forgot to make your own friends while in it (or lost them in the split), we got you! &nbsp;If you're a femme couple or the femme in a couple and you're missing hang time with just the girls, we are your people!</span></p>
<p>The easiest way to get to know us is at&nbsp;<strong>Femme au Lait,</strong> our casual Saturday morning meetup that rotates around different Portland area cafes and gets rave reviews. &nbsp;Often imitated, never duplicated, it&nbsp;really doesn't get any easier than this. Seriously! &nbsp;No agenda, no cliques, everyone just clicks.</p>
<p>When you sign up we'll ask for your ideas and what this group can do for you so you'll want to stay involved, host events, and perhaps tell a femme friend or two (or six!)</p>
<p>But first, a few important guidelines:</p>
<p>1. <strong>We lean heavily towards the L</strong> in the LGBTQEIEIO alphabet soup, so please... be a lady, be a lesbian, be femme. &nbsp;(We get there are various degrees of femme.&nbsp;You know who you are!)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;<strong>Your main profile photo must be an identifiable photo of you</strong>. &nbsp;Its important, fair, and safe that your co-members know who you are. We're a&nbsp;<span>private group and no one outside of our group can see our member list.</span></p>
<p>If you have a valid reason for why it's absolutely impossible to have a photo that shows your cute little face, please email us before joining.</p>
<p>Oh, and plea<span>se use your real first name,</span> like grownups do. &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Boundaries</strong><span>. &nbsp;Know them. &nbsp;Don't cross them. &nbsp;Leave the drama at the door. Its as simple as that.</span></p>
<p><span>4.</span> <strong><span>Be happy, be genuine, be you!</span></strong></p>
<p><span>So come in, or out, or whatever the case may be, femme friends! You know you want to. 2015 has been rockin and we'd love for you to help us kick some meetup ass without smearing our makeup!</span></p>
<p>Laura, Wendy, and the rest of your people</p></hr> </html>

<p>Hello all!<br>

My passion in life is the Law of Attraction and inspiration.  My groups are proactive as we  put together creation sessions where vibrations are increased and we move closer to our goals and dreams!</p>
<p><br>

About me,... I've been studying and teaching the Abraham material since 1996.Wow, thats a long time right? :)  Once I heard the message it rang clearer then anything I'd ever heard before and fell in love with the principles. As Abraham would put it, "thrill bumps ran through my body" when I first heard the truth of the words and continues to do so to this day!</p>
<p>I've attended three workshops with Jerry and Ester, in Philadelphia and NY and Portland and was in the hot seat. ;)</p>
<p><br>

Lets have fun here!!   <br>

Happy deliberate creating!</p>
<p>Blessings and love, <br>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Portland">Girl Develop It Portland</a></h2>for: <b>633</b> Nerdettes<br>Women Developers and Programmers!
Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it.
It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask "stupid questions."
We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites).
Stay tuned to this meetup for upcoming scheduled classes.</hr> </html>

<p><span style="font-size : x-small">We acknowledge that the Earth and its resources are finite, are currently under duress, and that our lives are inseparably interwoven with that of all other beings (listen: <a href="http://www.portlandinsight.org/talks/090215_BudddhistViewOfEnvironmentalism.mp3">Buddhist View of Environmentalism</a>). We seek to understand our lives in the context of the web of life in which we co-exist, and to live respectfully and responsibly with all of that life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : x-small">Recognizing that our actions have a profound impact upon our happiness and that of others we aspire to be guided by the five ethical precepts of the Buddha (see our <a href="http://www.portlandinsight.org/talks/pimc_chants.pdf">chant sheet pdf</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : x-small">You do not have to become a 'Buddhist' to practice at PIMC. There is no dogma to believe in. Instead you will be invited to explore your own experience of life using the tools of meditation and reflection with the support of a warm and caring community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : x-small">Insight Meditation (Vipassana), has continued as a living practice for 2500 years. At its heart is the practice of mindfulness, the simple and systematic cultivation of the mind and heart. It is the non-judgmental, moment-to-moment investigation of the body, feelings, and consciousness through calm, and focused awareness. Practiced regularly, mindfulness meditation relieves stress, has beneficial effects upon the body, and promotes the healing of psychological and emotional wounds. Ultimately, meditation nurtures the development of love, compassion, and freedom from suffering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size : x-small"><strong>See the <a href="http://www.portlandinsight.org/practice_schedule.html">Events Page</a> for weekly and special meditation sessions.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : x-small">The Portland Insight Meditation Community began in 1978 as the Portland Vipassana Sangha. <a href="http://www.robertbeatty.com/">Robert Beatty</a> is the founding and guiding teacher. He traces his lineage through <a href="http://www.robertbeatty.com/ruth.html">Ruth Denison</a> and the Burmese teacher U Ba Khin. With the assistance of <a href="http://www.douglaspullin.com/">Doug Pullin</a>, <a href="http://www.mindfulbalancetaichi.com/">Jim Dalton</a>, Nancy Turner and others too numerous to mention PIMC has grown into a thriving community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : x-small">PIMC has a wide range of programs that include frequent opportunities for meditation and classes, as well as informal opportunities for developing friendships with others on the spiritual path. You are invited to inquire further and to visit us at the center.</span></p>
<p>The Portland Insight Meditation Community is open to all. Those interested in mindfulness meditation are invited to visit whenever they wish. Visit our calendar for meeting times. See our Events Page for carpooling information.</p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Eat-Play-Live-Women-Portland-surrounding-areas">Eat, Play, Live! (Women-Portland & surrounding areas)</a></h2>for: <b>457</b> Women<br><p>We're a group of women&nbsp;looking to make new friends in casual, social environments.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is a large group with a small group feel.&nbsp; We have some events that are open to as many people who want to come and we also have some events with limited attendance.&nbsp; We set the event for what is a good match for the situation, which is determined by the event organizer.&nbsp; We'd of course love for those limited events to be thought of as "the more the merrier", but that isn't always easy for the group to be able to connect if we have as many people in attendance.&nbsp; So, for the events with limited attendance... it's a first come/first serve (whoever RSVP's first), usually with a waiting list.</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;planned&nbsp;activities will include brunch, lunch, and evening gatherings any day of the week.&nbsp; Popular activities will include socializing, movies, local dining, Happy Hours (that double as a meal instead of a snack),&nbsp;bbqs, potlucks, parties, game &amp; movie nights, shopping, trivia nights, outings (festivals, expos, etc&), Saturday Market, farmers market, day trips to the beach or mountain, small hikes, and so much more. The sky is the limit and we are open to suggestions from group members.</p>
<p>Our events will mostly occur in Portland. Some exceptions will be made for Mt. Hood, the Coast, Hood River, Vancouver, Clackamas, the West side, etc... You are welcome to join our group if you&nbsp;live in Oregon or SW Washington.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;get asked often what age range of people usually attend the activities.&nbsp; The people who show up to the group are about 35-75.&nbsp; Our group is getting big, so at this time we are&nbsp;going to be accepting <strong>ages 35+</strong> with exceptions made for&nbsp;"old souls". &nbsp;All people who identify as female are welcome.&nbsp; There is one man in this group, David Brown (my husband).&nbsp; He takes our group on some hikes and walks.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have activities that our guys can come along with us and our children too.&nbsp; Those activities are usually marked in the subject header *F/F which means Friends/Family.&nbsp; The age range for each activity is posted in the description of the event and varies with each activity.&nbsp; If there are spots available for an activity and&nbsp;you are wondering if you can bring loved ones to the activity, just send the event host/organizer a private message and ask if that will work for that particular activity.&nbsp; There is almost always space for "Plus One's".&nbsp; Plus ones are females over 18 you want to bring with you to the activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We understand when you can't show up to an activity.&nbsp; Occasionally even the organizers&nbsp;have also had to change our plans due to the fact that life happens.&nbsp; We totally understand.&nbsp; Although, communication about this is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; If you can't attend something-please update your RSVP to an UnRSVP as far in advance as possible.&nbsp; This gives someone else a chance to&nbsp;get that particular spot at an activity (a lot of our events have changed to limited attendance).&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you have a habit of being a "no show", or not communicating about&nbsp;these things&nbsp;or you even cancel often... it is likely that the group owner of this group&nbsp;will&nbsp;give preference with spots on the waitlist&nbsp;to:&nbsp; People who don't cancel as much, are better about readily updating their RSVP's, and members who communicate better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group owner reserves the right to remove members at their discretion, for any reason.&nbsp; If you are exceptionally obnoxious, you're probably not a good match for our group.&nbsp; Drama-Free clause: Life is already complicated enough. If you wish to bring drama to a group, please move on to an acting class.&nbsp;:) Our group is committed to providing a fun, casual and open environment to its members.&nbsp; When you attend events, please help us cultivate&nbsp;an accepting environment of all walks of life.&nbsp; </p>

<p> <br></p>
<p>Solicitation, advertising, and sponsorships:&nbsp;We sometimes will entertain the idea of having someone who has a special skill, class, service, business, etc... to share with the group which of course will lead to them having more customers in the future.&nbsp; If you have a product or service you would like to share with the group, contact the organizers for consideration.&nbsp; Although, the main purpose for being in the group is friendship rather than potential business&nbsp;opportunities.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We love suggestions for activities or want to be an event host or an event organizer.&nbsp; Please email Angela Brown eatpraysnorkel@gmail.com&nbsp;and I can walk you through what we're looking for in an event host and how to set up activities.&nbsp; We're open to you letting us know if you want to go do something and want to drag the group along with you. : )&nbsp; (examples: "Hey, I'm going to this [lecture, concert, festival, etc...]&nbsp;and would like some company; anyone want to meet me there?")</p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Portland-Lucid-Dreaming-OBE-and-Astral-Projection">Portland Oregon Lucid Dreaming, OBE, and Astral Projection</a></h2>for: <b>456</b> Dreamers and Projectors<br>Learning to lucid dream, astral project, or have an out of body experience requires work and practice in the real world.

I have personally had many lucid dreams, and have even had an incredible out of body experience.  I know others that have seen/predicted the future in their dreams with amazing accuracy and detail.

For decades I have read about people with money (grants) performing lucid dream experiments in labs with high tech equipment and often thought how cool it would be to get involved with something like that.

The truth is, none of the experiments I've read about are terribly difficult or expensive to conduct.  All you need is a group of people willing to share in the experience together.

To start with, this group will do nothing more than to meet in public places and have discussions about dreaming, dream interpretation, lucidity, astral projection and out of body experiences.  We will share books, information, and ideas on the subject.  This may be all that some of the members of this group ever do.

However, as we get to know each other better, some of us may choose to have meditation or dream sessions together.  Maybe we can have an observer watch while others fall asleep, then play sounds and music (or flashing lights) to alert the sleeper in an REM state to the fact that s/he is dreaming.  The possibilities are exciting and endless.

Obviously such sessions would require a certain level of trust amongst each other.  We can discuss these possibilities in the future when the time is right.</hr> </html>

The group serves to send a message to new-comers that they are welcome in the Shambhala Buddhist tradition, and to explore (perhaps in ways that may be unintentionally overlooked or excluded in our regular programming) how we as gays, lesbians, bisexuals, trans and gender queer individuals can incorporate the teachings in our everyday lives and in our various social circles. We're scheduled to meet every first Sunday of the month 2-4pm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experience your mind as discovered through meditation - instruction is available to you. We practice mindfulness as a group - noticing what arises and constantly coming back to the present moment. We also practice generosity by bringing a small monetary donation (one or two dollars) to each meeting if possible. &nbsp;these funds help to keep the Shambhala Center, our host, operational.</p>
<p>Come as you are - no experience necessary and there are plenty of cushions and chairs. &nbsp;</p>

Whether you've been eating and exercising like a caveman for a while, you're a recent convert enjoying some new found health and energy, or you're simply curious based on the latest news piece touting the benefits of a little prehistoric thinking, we welcome you with open arms (both probably holding steaks).  Portland Paleo will foster discussions and meet ups focused on shunning the misguided mainstream dietary and health advice instead looking to the practices that made our species the top level predator it is today with increasing scientific support. Some people turn to this lifestyle as a way to lose weight, some are simply looking to obtain optimum fitness results, while some seek the paleo lifestyle to treat or fix any number of health issues such as autoimmune diseases, cognitive malfunctions, nutrient imbalances, or even just plain old acne and lethargy.  We'll foster not only a learning environment for those of us still seeking answers but also ways to simply connect with other forward thinking and increasingly more healthy individuals!</p></hr> </html>

I've found it's hard to make friends and build sustainable community in that way. &nbsp;Looking for folks with similar values and similar language? This meetup is about creating community with like-minded Buddhist oriented friends from all traditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relational dharma is a beautiful aspect of deepening into our hearts. This is a place to spend time with folks who are passionate about their path, as well as looking for friends to spend time with. &nbsp;The possibilities of our various types of events are endless... philosophizing at a tea shop; hiking in nature; relational dharma practice, goofing around; connecting and introducing each other to fun activities; engaging in dialogues about practice and supporting each other along the path. Almost all of our events have a practice element (meditation) to them as well as a less formal opportunity to get to know each other. &nbsp;No need to identify as a Buddhist - simply having an interest and experience with it is enough.</p>
<p>Folks of all abilities, ethnicities, sexual-orientations, genders, socio-economic backgrounds and ages are welcome.</p>
<p>Oh and... we are connected to a Facebook page too... join us!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/portlandbuddhisthangoutsangha/" class="linkified">https://www.facebook.com/groups/portlandbud...</a></p>

Members get together for concerts, live music, theatre, film, dining out, board games, topic-focused discussion groups, hiking, kayaking, walking, and day trips organized by members as well as many other activities. &nbsp;LOCA hosts a holiday party in December, a picnic in June or July, and a monthly potluck gathering. &nbsp;Come to the potlucks to find women your age to play, laugh, and eat with. &nbsp;At the potluck you can find out what's happening now, start your own group based on your interest, and maybe run into someone you haven't seen for a long time. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Joining Meetup is not the same thing as joining LOCA. &nbsp;Think of this Meetup page as the bulletin board outside the auditorium that is the LOCA group. &nbsp;It gives you an idea of what's going on but doesn't give you the full experience of what it means to be LOCA. &nbsp;Please email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:lesbianscertainage@gmail.com"><strong>lesbianscertainage@gmail.com</strong></a> to get on our mailing list and start receiving the newsletter.</p>
<p><span>Our aim is to foster community, which is difficult for women as we get older. &nbsp;Too many lesbians of our age are sitting home alone wishing there was a way to meet women like us and that we had someone to play with. &nbsp;Here it is!! &nbsp;Your big chance!! &nbsp;Come on out--of the house, that is! &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>LOCA has a mailing list of over 350 women who meet and mingle in different small- to medium-sized groups. &nbsp;ALL older (than about 55) lesbians are welcome to check us out. &nbsp;There are no membership dues, although when something is scheduled at the Q Center they ask that each attendee make a small donation for operating costs. &nbsp;Attendees at the potlucks are asked to bring a dish to share. &nbsp;Otherwise, the cost of the day is getting there and socializing. &nbsp;</p></hr> </html>
<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Burn-Wild-Writing-Workshop-Class-in-Portland">"Burn Wild" Writing Workshop & Class in Portland</a></h2>for: <b>387</b> Writers, Artists, Creators<br><p>This is a workshop-style class meeting in February. We'll help you start or continue on the journey of finding your creative voice. Youll learn how to silence the critic and gain confidence as a writer, literary artist, or artist. Whatever it is youre hoping to create, well lay a foundation for you to know yourself creatively.<br>

</p>
<p>Youll overcome those nagging thoughts that have frozen your abilities in the past. Youll discover tools of language, art, and creative thinking that will unleash your most creative self and your wildest ideas. What you thought impossible for you will become possible. For February, we'll focus on "the dream of the story."<br>

</p>
<p>This class is generative, which means you dont have to come with any writing or project in hand. You will leave with a number of ideas, stories, and beginnings which will expand your possibilities for 2014 and beyond. Based on the book Burn Wild: A Writer's Guide to Creative Breakthrough. (Avail at Amazon.)<img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/4/2/600_320974882.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px"></p></hr> </html>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Qi-gong-at-Whole-Being-Health">Qi-gong at Whole Being Health</a></h2>for: <b>380</b> Energy seekers<br><p>The Qi-gong classes we are presenting at Whole Being Health are focused primarily around Yin cultivation. We will be teaching Qi-gong forms called One Thousand Hands Of Buddha, Morning Medical, Essence, Turtle Longevity, and Remedy Routines. &nbsp;The purpose of teaching these Yin cultivating forms is to place you in a different perspective to this false Yang culture we all live in. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These forms will aid a person to become more relaxed in their daily lives, and live with more joy and love in their daily routines. &nbsp;These Qi-gong forms will help reduce the over stimulation of the adrenal glands (sympathetic nervous system), and help to turn on the para-sympathetic nervous system which helps us to relax and perform efficient digestive processes (assimilation and excretion).</p>
<p>If you find that your lifestyle is depleting your energy, disturbing your sleep, disrupting you digestion, or making your body feel heavy and stagnant, then these Yin cultivating Qi-gong forms are right for you. Please come join us and learn how to empower yourself by moving your own energy or Qi, in the directions that will benefit you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></hr> </html>

Hood - less than an hour from Portland. Of course focused on living a sustainable, environmentally conscious, connected to spirit lifestyle but perhaps more importantly, we aim to create a loving, nurturing home and <strong>seek emotionally mature members</strong> who are <strong>truly willing to do the emotional work it takes to be in community and are willing to contribute their time, talents and treasure.</strong> We meet in Portland to discuss Creating a Community from the Ground Up with the book Creating a Life Together, as well as many other resources.</p>
<p>During the summer we are out on the land building with cob, putting in permaculture features, HAVING FUN camping out while&nbsp;sharing our thoughts about community and getting to know each other. During the winter,&nbsp; we occasionally head up to the land with a small project in mind, plant trees, and host&nbsp; planning and get to know you meetings in town at Fiona's house. One gathering is a social event such as a potluck and movie on community or sustainability as well as discussion, the other is a business meeting to hash out more details on how to structure our community and create our vision.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing our knowledge and hearts with you and combining our strengths to make our new home as idyllic, sustainable, regenerative, and most importantly, as loving as possible.</p></hr> </html>
<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/HolisticVoiceLab">Holistic Voice Lab / ReMerging Voice Events Portland</a></h2>for: <b>379</b> Singers<br><p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/a/9/c/600_432643676.jpeg"></p>
<p><b>At Holistic Voice Lab we approach singing as a healing art.</b></p>
<p><b>ReMerging Voice Events help individuals free their natural voices. We offer events that are fun, transforming and community driven. When you free your voice, beautiful things happen.</b></p>
<p><b>We are all born singers. Life sometimes shuts down the remembrance of this fundamental right.</b></p>
<p><b>ReMerge with us!</b></p>
<p><b>Listed below are a few of our offerings:</b></p>
<p><b>CircleSinging </b>can be described lots of ways:&nbsp;vocal improvisation, vocal jamming, add-a-part/change-a-part, vocal orchestra, , a drum circle for singers, or just plain make it up singing. Its done all over the world in countless different ways and it dates back to the earliest forms of human singing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CircleSinging can be described as tribal, meditative and FUN medicine!</b> It is different from song circles in that each song is an improvised A Cappella chorus / chant and done as a group. The group leader weaves the tapestry of motor, counterpoint, melody, harmony and rhythms. Within the group dynamic, opportunities for individual expression are encouraged but not required! We like to think of it as a "mistake-free zone."&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.meetup.com/HolisticVoiceLab/events/220940249/">7 Weeks of Vocal Improv Fun!</a> </b>Learn the art of vocal improvisation with Marie Black. Classes are for all levels. In this iterative learning style, we touch on vocal technique, basic music theory, blending, listening and making vocal improvisation a beautiful expression of both group and individuation. Eventually, you may become eligible to sing with One Heart Spontaneous Singers! <br> </p>
<p><b>Improvisational Singing and CircleSinging:</b></p>
<p>Promotes deep self-expression.</p>
<p>Connects us to ourselves.</p>
<p>Connects us with others.</p>
<p>Promotes self-confidence.</p>
<p>Creates a sacred space.</p>
<p>Releases emotions. <br> </p>
<p>Unlocks our own inner world of creativity.</p>
<p>Creates a sense of joy and oneness.</p>
<p>When we sing together our hearts align and beat as one - science says so!</p>

<p><b>A little bit about me, Marie Black, your facilitator:&nbsp;</b>CircleSongs originated from Bobby McFerrin's&nbsp;Voicestra&nbsp;A Cappello vocal group in the Bay Area. My long time voice teacher Raz Kennedy was a founding member. Through him I had a chance to be part of the largest CircleSong ever. 2500 people packed into Grace Cathedral on New Year's Eve 1991 as Bobby's Chant For World Peace went on for 24 hours. I was one of the singers up front with Bobby helping him pass parts to the audience. I was awed at the fundamental depth of connection and love we all felt. Towards midnight, everyone placed a few fingers on our neighbors' heart chakras as we chanted in the new year. I was hooked but it would take two decades to find Bobby again in his CircleSongs workshops. It has changed my life. <br></p></hr> </html>
<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Portland-Laughter-Yoga">Portland Laughter Yoga</a></h2>for: <b>376</b> Laughers<br><p><b>Alo-haa-ha!</b></p>
<p>Portland Laughter Yoga is the premiere Portland metro area Laughter Yoga resource offering Certified Laughter Yoga Leader Trainings, Laughter Clubs &amp; Classes, corporate, celebrations, sessions for seniors, caregivers, kids and more! This Meet-up will be used to announce Laughter Clubs, Laughter Yoga classes, trainings and special events sponsored by Portland Laughter Yoga.</p>
<p><b>What's Going On?</b><br> Laughter Clubs are a community event. We would love to offer them for free, but space is hard to come by so we have a recommended donation of $5 to $10 dollars. No one will be turned away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, the oldest recurring Meetup is the Hawthorne Laughter Club, which meets on Sundays at 4 pm in the movement studio at Hawthorne Wellness Center. There are other weekly clubs happening&nbsp; that are listed, as well as occasional special events.<br></p>
<p>We joined Meetup in 2011, but Portland Laughter Yoga has been holding clubs, classes and trainings since 2008. Meetup is simply a new way to get the word out about Laughter Yoga and related events. We think laughing is AWESOME and want to share it with everyone! Please do not think that just because not many people are listed as attending on Meetup that no one is going. We have many regular laughers that attend our functions that are not tapped into Meetup.<br> <br></p>
<p><span><strong>What is Laughter Yoga?</strong></span></p>
<p>Laughter Yoga (www.laughteryoga.org) is a unique new physical activity that blends playful and energizing laughter exercises with gentle yogic breathing and rhythmic clapping and chanting. It is fun &amp; easy! No sweat pants or yoga mat required. During the second half of a session we use intentional laughter as a tool, not an emotion during laughter meditation - we just sit or lay back and laugh!</p>
<p>Through group activity and eye contact, simulated laughter quickly becomes real, contagious and enthusiastic. By the time the laughter meditation starts people usually have no problem tapping into their inner laugh. I love Laughter Yoga for its ease and simplicity. Laughter has so many physical, spiritual, emotional and social benefits and anyone can do it!</p></hr> </html>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/LadyMonsterSlayers">Lady Monster-Slaying Society ~ Portland RPG/Gaming</a></h2>for: <b>366</b> Monster-Slayers<br><p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/c/d/4/event_238896052.jpeg" style="max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : right"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We focus on creating a fun and friendly way for women to join RPGs and similar games regardless of experience levels. The only prerequisite for joining the Lady Monster-Slaying Society is that you are ready to... SLAY SOME MONSTERS!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The LMSS is a diverse bunch of misfits who currently have several ongoing D&amp;D 4E campaigns that meet at Red Castle Games. We also have at least one other non-D&amp;D meetup every month. May 2013 featured a Euro Game gathering and Lady Monster-Slayer-aoke party! We'd like to see some non-D&amp;D games organized too! Can you help?</p>
<p>Our organizers came together with the hope that with enough blood, sweat, tears (ie: lots of personal time and money spent), we could create the kind of community that we have always wanted to exist for Ladies that like to slay monsters. That is positive and welcoming.  We are gamer geeks, just like you!</p>
<p>Please join us if ANY of the below sound like you -</p>
<p>- You are a (friendly) GM/DM or experienced player and looking for minions.</p>
<p>- You have always been RPG curious (maybe you experimented in your youth, and have thought about finding more people like you). We are your people!</p>
<p>- You are an experienced player who wants to find a new group of people to play with. And, are excited about the opportunity to share what you know.</p>
<p>- You want a place to host a calendar for a female-friendly game with the option to open seats to other awesome people when you have a missing adventurer.</p>
<p>- You are a lady who likes to slay monsters, or a friendly guy who is open to female energy games and who will be ok with the fact that the many of our events are women only.</p>
<p>- You play video game RPGs way too much and want to do something similar, but with humans face-to-face, whether you have the exp or not.</p>
<p>For the DUDES MONSTER SLAYERS OUT THERE - Just to reiterate - you are welcome to join us, especially if you want to start or join female-friendly campaigns or encounters and don't mind letting us keep some gatherings female-only.  Just keep in mind: Comments like "You can be the cheerleader," or "I shall defend your honor" may be your attempt to flatter, but will most likely be taken as old fashioned sexism - these comments insinuate ladies are only good for boobs, and not for kicking ass.  We like to kick ass. We like to kick ass - with fun and respectful dudes!</p>
<p>Also - we take RSVPs seriously because you are reserving a seat that someone else may be dying for (or hoping to not die for, if the GM is nice enough). If you miss two events that you RSVP "yes" to without updating your RSVP to "no" within a reasonable amount of time in advance you will be booted back to your village and stripped of your Monster-Slaying title.  Just don't be a jerk - easy!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly for the Ladies only -  we are an RPG focused spin-off of the "Portland Women's Gaming Group" &amp; the "Gals and Games" Meetup groups who play mostly Euros. If you have interest in other types of games (Euro or otherwise), you should check them out too. Gals and Games is particularly great for learning new Euros.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let's Slay!!</p>

We live in a place that encompasses such diverse types of water in so many different and beautiful settings, it's fantastic to use and share our group knowledge with each other to learn about them.&nbsp; Because our weather here in the northwest is generally mild, <strong>we do paddle year round with proper equipment</strong>, but notice that well also be posting pool sessions throughout the colder months so you can continue to have the opportunity to improve your skills even if you dont want to brave the elements and colder winter water temperatures. The side benefits to our events, indoors and out, are the friendships that develop between members, and we try to accommodate those with after-paddle camaraderie at local restaurants so we encourage you to attend those too.</span></p>
<p><span>Its also important to know that <strong>Kayak Portland is an open group</strong> and depends upon all of us to keep it going strong.&nbsp; I encourage you to think about places you want to paddle or share with the group and then either host an event, ask myself or the assistant organizers to host the event, or place it in the suggested meet-up section.&nbsp; Hosting is not hard, and we can help you with the details, so please ask if youd like to try it!&nbsp; Well support you as much as you need. &nbsp;A reminder that only actual <strong>paddling events</strong> are posted on our main event page, though, so if you'd like to share something happening in the community with our group I ask that you post it on the discussion board and it will be emailed to all members.</span></p>
<p><span><em><span>What being an open group means:</span></em> <strong>if 3 people agree to "suggest-a-meet-up" then the meet-up will automatically happen and can be edited by the attendees</strong>. Please note that myself or the assistant organizers check through each event description to make sure important and relevant details are there, so don't feel offended if we fix spelling, maps, or details that we think might make it more clear. &nbsp;We will contact the event organizer before making any major edits. &nbsp;Also, please note that each Event Organizer has the right to ask a paddler/s to NOT paddle with the group if they feel that person/s is willfully acting in a way that is a danger to the group. &nbsp;We take safety seriously and want everyone to feel comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>***</strong>We are happy to have members in our group who also happen to be employees at each of the kayaking/gear stores in the metro area. That said, even if an event has the store name in the event description, please remember that these are ultimately <strong>free Kayak Portland events</strong> and the stores and their employees in no way have any liability during paddles. (See the liability waiver below.)</span></p>
<p><span>Please read the electronic and legally reviewed waiver that protects all members as well as leaders from any coincidental or accidental occurrences which could render liability for creating, participating, or attending a meet-up. Kayaking, as any water sport, has inherent dangers, and as paddlers we need to respect and acknowledge these. Basically in short; take care of others as you would yourself and learn about and use proper equipment.</span></p>
<p><span>Again, welcome to Kayak Portland and I look forward to meeting you at an event soon!</span></p>
<p><span>~ Julie</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Our Philosophy:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>KAYAK PORTLAND is a non-professional meet-up group that only provides a way for you to connect with others who enjoy kayaking and associated activities. Think of KAYAK PORTLAND as a group of new and old friends getting together for fun and mostly our brand of fun is called kayaking. KAYAK PORTLAND is not a professional adventure organization or outfitter operation. <br> <br> Kayaking can be physically and mentally demanding. Kayaking can involve significant risks and hazards, such as collision with power boats, hypothermia, joint or trauma injuries and even drowning. &nbsp;Injury, both personal and property, may occur while traveling to or from</span></span> <span><span>KAYAK PORTLAND</span></span> <span><span>Activity. &nbsp;All participants in a&nbsp;Kayak Portland&nbsp;activity - you, family members and guests - by participation in a Kayak Portland activity, acknowledge awareness of the risks, foreseen and unforeseen, which are inherent in each meet-up's activities and cannot be eliminated without destroying the unique character of the activity. &nbsp;These inherent risks include, but are not limited to, the dangers of serious personal injury, property damage, and death from participation in or travel to and from the activity.</span></span></p>

Often in this group setting, their work is more affordable than in private sessions. We are beginning to host <b>Psychic Galleries with specific themes</b> as well.

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/ColumbiaRiverMTB">CRMB(Columbia River Mountain Bikers)</a></h2>for: <b>331</b> Mountain Bikers<br><p><span>Welcome to CRMB we are a wide range of riders from beginners to experience. We try our best to cater to every level of rider and leave no one behind and I mean no one. All rides will have a detailed description&nbsp;of what type of ride it is, and what level of experience is needed. Trust me when I say I was a beginner also at one time who was intimidated at my first meetup group ride at Sandy Ridge on my hardtail. But I found great leadership at CRMB that made feel comfortable and help me build confidence.</span></p> 
<p><span>We currently have a couple sponsors so membership is free. We have a "chip in" option if you would like to donate it is&nbsp;totally&nbsp;voluntary. &nbsp;We are one of the&nbsp;busiest&nbsp;mountain&nbsp;bike groups in the NW with the most group rides happening all year around. Our ride leaders are very&nbsp;knowledgeable&nbsp;and experienced. So if mountain biking is your thing then you have come to the right place. Everyone is welcome to ride at their own level no pressure to take chances or be in a hurry this is not a race. I take my position seriously and expect the same from the rest of the ride leaders. You are welcome to become a ride leader and post your own rides. If this interest you email me and we can discuss this. We require a facial photo in your profile for safety so you can&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;other riders when showing up for a ride.</span></p> 
<p><span>If you&nbsp;commit&nbsp;or RSVP to a ride please show up or cancel. Meetup.com has a great phone app to help you with this please download it, its extremely handy. You must respect all members period! We do not tolerate rude disrespectful people. When you show up to rides please bring the&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;stuff/equipment, water, bike tools and extra tube, master link, tire pump, patch kit, hydration pack, tire irons, wet wipes. proper safety and riding gear,&nbsp;energy&nbsp;snacks, and most of all be 99% ready to ride. Please do not have other plans, weddings birthdays, hot dates, or other&nbsp;agendas&nbsp;and show up to ride. &nbsp;Nothing is more disrespectful then to show up and be in a hurry and create a bad vibe.</span></p> 
<p><span>Riders always ask me what is considered a beginner? My answer is always the same. &nbsp;Mountain biking takes a lot of energy and a high fitness level is needed. You can always get off your bike walk around the scary tough obstacle or the trail section you don't feel like riding. But if you are out of energy on a 10-15 mile ride it can be dangerous especially when the sun starts going down and you now have to ride back. So with that said know your limits and abilities or ask questions before joining a ride that might be over your head, feel free to email me anytime. The key to having a good ride is coming&nbsp;prepared I to have left my socks and gloves at home.</span></p> 
<p><span>Most of all have fun!</span></p> 
<p><span>Your membership with CRMB&nbsp;entitles&nbsp;you to reduce cost bike&nbsp;maintenance I will usually fix any members bike for a Starbucks Venti &nbsp;Americano. I own a large set of bicycle tools including a truing stand, bearing press, brake bleed tools, and know how to use them. From a basic derailleur adjustment to tubeless tire setup, bearing&nbsp;replacement&nbsp;you name it I can do it. I am always willing to show members how to work on their own bikes. I also know how to find the best deals in town</span> on parts and equipment you might need. Need help selling your mountain bike or parts let me know I have the experience and all the ins and outs along with a few tricks up my sleeve when it comes to Craiglist, eBay and other &nbsp;mountain bike forums to help you move your mountain biking stuff.</p> 
<p>And finally you also get a wide range of experienced riders to help you learn and become a better rider and ride some of the best trails in the northwest. We are a diverse group and respect all demographics. So come join us and see why CRMB is simple the best mountain bike meetup group.</p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Portland-Womens-Red-Tent-Meetup">Portland Women's Red Tent Meetup</a></h2>for: <b>326</b> Goddesses<br><p>If you believe women should have a place to go to in order to connect with other women, relax, reflect and celebrate what it means to be a woman, then this group is for you.</p>
<p>My name is Susan Landa and I live in Portland. Years ago when I read The Red Tent, by Anita Diamant, it awakened a call in me. Each month when my moon came around, Id think, Darn it! I wish there was a red tent I could go to! I felt the void not only for myself, but for all women. My mission is to make the red tent concept more mainstream, encouraging women to honor and celebrate their cycles easily. I believe our culture is ready for this paradigm shift- from dishonoring to revering the female moon cycle.</p>
<p>Im working to start a business of modern day red tents. The first one will be in our hometown and will serve as a model to franchise. When I have amassed enough followers, I will crowd source the start-up capital. Please share my FB page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Moondays">https://www.facebook.com/Moondays</a> , website www.moondays.com, connect with us on Twitter @MyMoondays, and Pintrest&nbsp; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Moondays" class="linkified">https://www.facebook.com/Moondays</a> and help spread the word so this can become a reality. Here are some of the benefits of the business model:</p>
<br>
<p>" It will encourage women to take time out for themselves and be with other women, reflect, get feedback, learn, relax and pamper themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>" The space would be open and easily accessible every day! Women could come and go or stay for a while.</p>
<br>
<p>" It would give women meaningful jobs and a means to own their own businesses through the franchise system.</p>
<br>
<p>" It would be a fixture in the business world. This will create dialog about it in the mainstream helping shift the repressive, old, negative paradigm around menstruation.</p>

<p><span>We love playing classical music.</span></p>
<p><span>We love listening to classical music.</span></p>
<p><span>We are tired of the elitist and inaccessible nature of the classical world.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe that there are many that would enjoy classical music if they could access it in a setting that is comfortable for them.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe classical musicians should be allowed to perform in a setting that is more casual - where the audience is allowed to have a drink, eat a scone, laugh a little, and clap a lot.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe everyone can enjoy the music that we love.</span></p></hr> </html>
<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Food-As-Medicine-Meetup">PDX Food as Medicine Meetup</a></h2>for: <b>309</b> Food Healers<br><p>Welcome to the PDX Food As Medicine Meetup group!&nbsp; Are you interested to know more about improving and maintaining your health with food? <br></p>
<p><span>We believe and acknowledge that what we feed our bodies makes us what we are and affects every aspect of our lives!&nbsp; For a long time we have forgotten the power of food to nourish and heal. &nbsp;As in the ancient wisdom traditions (Ayurveda, Chinese Medicine, Native American Medicine), food has always been the first line of defense in preventing and treating disease.&nbsp; The body is programmed to heal itself when it is provided with the right tools. &nbsp;There is nothing more natural than food. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Food as Medicine is defined as:&nbsp; fresh, aligned with nature and the seasons, whole (food in its purest forms), free of toxins, good for digestion, and plant-strong.</span> <br> </p>
<p>Our intention is to cover all aspects of Food as Medicine: considering the source of our food, making mindful choices in the preparation and eating of food, recognizing the value of coming together as community to share food, learning about the medicinal properties of various foods, understanding proper digestion and how food is used to help the body heal, and discussing research indicating that a plant-strong diet is essential to prevent and reverse illness and disease.&nbsp; Along the way, we'll offer a variety of information and activities that we hope will educate and inspire you to live more healthfully and share what you know with those around you! <br></p>
<p>We welcome:</p>
<p>" a desire to learn about using Food as Medicine <br> </p>
<p>" expertise and passion to share how you have healed yourself and others using Food as Medicine <br> </p>
<p>" members providing resources to our community that values Food as Medicine (through lecture, workshops, presentations, classes, sponsorship, products and services aligned with our mission) <br> </p>
<p>" an open mind ready to deconstruct all that we have learned and been taught throughout our lives about nutrition and medicine <br></p>
<p>" active participation in the group by sharing ideas and wisdom regarding Food as Medicine <br></p>
<p><br> </p>
<p>We hope to teach, learn, grow, and heal in partnership with all of you!</p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/DanceLife-Portland-Meetup">DanceLife Portland Meetup</a></h2>for: <b>300</b> Dancers<br><p>A group dedicated to dancing for social, emotional, and physical health. We are a dance studio, but also a community of people who love to use dance as a means to express ourselves and meet people that you would otherwise get a chance to meet. Whether it's taking a dance class together, or creating practice groups, going out dancing, building a flash mob, or watching a dance related movie together, we want to do that with you. The Viscount Dance Studio offers classes, dances, practice space, dance parties, and even a dance-film movie night (if you can call Xanadu a film!). We are all about the people and relationships that are formed here, and the transformations people see in their lives when they enter a dance community. Come join us!</p></hr> </html>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Lets-Celebrate-Social-Anxiety">Celebrating Social Anxiety</a></h2>for: <b>290</b> Anxients<br><p>Social anxiety (SA) is a process of engagement in multiplicitious and progressively absorbing strategies of alienation; from human beings in groups, from their collective activities, and from the artifacts those activities produce. Everyone experiences social anxiety to some degree at one time or another. The sad, wilting wallflower, and the lampshade-wearing life of the party, each exhibit its symptoms. The sea of faces on a city street, and the scared features revealed by a door held ajar, are outbreak maps of its epidemic reach. But relatively few  the truly anxious, or anxients - come to know SAs fullest potential. Anxients come in all shapes, sizes and ages. We come in all colors: in fact, we each come in a variety of colors, depending on whether we are calm, or feeling one of the Essential Three As (angry, afraid or ashamed.) We come from all backgrounds, and profess all belief systems. What we share as anxients, and what separates us from the mundanely anxious, is the degree to which our mental loathing and isolation influences our daily behavior, down to its minutest particulars. Anxiety is our constant companion and guide; our every decision is based on its counsel. Anxiety is, for us, an all-consuming way of life  and lets face it, its a heckuva lot of fun! If you think youve got what it takes to hang with some of the least appealing, most distant people in the Portland area, this meetup is for you. Were going to celebrate and explore our anxiety in all its forms, and were going to do it in as much style as our always ready sense of self-doubt will allow! Whether its convening in a public place like a café (although its really, really hard to imagine us doing that) to sit at averted angles and talk in half-audible mumbles, or one of our series of planned Adventures In Anxiety (the only group outings in town where every person hangs back ten paces from the rest of the company) in the Social Anxiety meetup youll find like-minded people empathetic to your plight (youll have to take that on faith since you wont be talking to them much.)</p></hr> </html>

I'd love to see this community grow and be a welcoming space for everyone!<br>

<br>

<p>I am also starting a songwriter's circle.  This is for people who write their own material.  We will get together to hear each other's materials, offer support and encouragement and it asked for constructive criticism, and to to share exercises that inspire creativity and new songs.</p>
<p>I also sometimes host a musicians' practice group.  This is for people who play instruments, and would like to build their skills - lead playing, harmonies, etc., build a song repertoire, perfect songs - while playing with others in an informal small group setting.</p>
<p>I like to keep each event fairly intimate, so there is a limit of 14 people for the jams. If the meetup fills up, you're invited to join the wait list.  For people who RSVP yes, please be considerate and if you can't attend let us know 2 days in advance.  That way, others who want to come have time to RSVP and plan to attend.  I will forgive no shows with good excuse once, but not twice!</p>
<p>Looking forward to making music with you.</p></hr> </html>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Depth-Experiences-through-Cannabis-Use-in-Nature">Depth Experiences through Cannabis Use in Nature</a></h2>for: <b>256</b> Depth Explorers<br><p>With the legalization of cannabis, we are putting it's capabilities to the test. This group is about creating depth experiences, with the focus on the experience itself rather than cannabis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My background is in outdoor guiding and using the power of nature to heal people in a psychological context. After working in this capacity I recognized that everything was different in the context of nature. This meet-up group creates community for the experiences, though while you are using cannabis the experience is designed to be a personal one.</p>
<p>Cannabis intensifies the present moment, feelings, thoughts and senses, which for most people results in an inward pull psychologically. Having an environment that helps to expand and intensify this state is vital for deepening the experience. The setting is crucial for the experience to take hold. Bringing back what your experience meant to you is a powerful way to anchor everything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The intention behind creating this group is to have a container where you can explore the high on your own terms. We do this in expansive natural areas so that presence is reflected everywhere without the concept of judgement from others. We set a social area where people can talk and where there are people to help you if you start to have a difficult experience, but outside of this area we ask people to respect each other by keeping silence.&nbsp;<span>We hope to hold a solid ratio of facilitators, those who hold the container and help with real world interactions, while the explorers flow through the underworld. We will consider this ratio in accordance to group size.</span></p>
<p><span>Some specifics: &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>-<b>This group is obviously only for those 21 and over</b>. No exceptions. Sorry if it speaks to you and you aren't of age, but we can't jeopardize the group by going outside of the law in this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-We will be going out into some beautiful natural areas. Whether we stay there overnight or we just go for the day, the experiences we will be trying to deliver are meant to be held in a beautiful, peaceful natural area. <b>Anyone is welcome regardless of outdoor experience</b>, but if you have strong aversion to wild nature the initial few times may be a challenge for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<b>The Experience does not belong to&nbsp;any single specific spiritual way of viewing things</b>.&nbsp;When one enters the depths it is difficult not to relate that to the language that one has around spirituality. All language regarding spirituality is welcome, if you chose to speak in such terms, though we do ask you to keep your interpretations to yourself rather than placing your views of spirituality on someone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<b>This is not a party or hook-up scene. </b>We have had some people come out and express this, and if that is your primary motivation then it could jeopardize the atmosphere of the depth experience. If you would feel safer with some type of buddy system, that is something that members can work out together either before or during the trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Finally,<b> the focus of this group is the depth experience</b>. Nature and cannabis help to bring this forward, but they are not the focus. Specifically, I feel it needs to be stated that <b>cannabis is not the focal point of this community. It isn't even required that you use. </b>If you can get to such levels of depth without using, by all means. I challenge such a concept unless you are currently a heavy user, but to there is still no requirement for use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope to see you swimming through the depths sometime.&nbsp;</p></hr> </html>
<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/creative-queer-women-in-PDX">Creative Queer Women in PDX</a></h2>for: <b>255</b> creative queers<br><p>Are you a songwriter, poet, writer, painter, dancer, yogi or other artist and you also identify as lesbian, bi, or queer? Do you want to reach out to other queer women that have similar interests and creative inklings? Do you have inspiring creations you want share or want to be in the presence of other inspiring acts of creativity? This group is for you/all of us creative queers in the world. The idea is that we will meet once or twice a month at a group member's house, or in a safe public space. At meetings there will be a chance for individuals to share their art form and be heard and seen by other creative queer women. We may showcase an artist or musician on a given night, providing a little more time and attention for their craft (this could be a performance, a discussion, or the facilitation of some kind of creative activity). The long term goal of the group is to have a Queer is Beautiful Arts Festival complete with our art on the walls, music and poetry performed on stage, and a chance to share our creations with the larger community. With all of the musical, poetic, and artistic talent, we could have one of Portland's queer-friendly spaces host us in sharing our creative talents and crafts with the larger Portland community. We will also develop a solid network and foundation of trust and support -- as queer women, and as creative women in this fabulous city.</p></hr> </html>

In other words, we like to play fancy board games. Come join us at one of our regular game nights.</p>
<p>We like our games on the lighter side of the spectrum. Games that can be played in 20 minutes to around an hour, beer in hand, with lots of laughing&nbsp;and interacting. Marathon games that take 3+ hours of quiet heavy thinking, not so much.&nbsp;This is all a long-winded way of saying: at The Cardboard Club, brains may sizzle, but they should never burn. Keep it light, keep it social, have fun!</p>
<p>The regulars bring games from their ever-expanding collections, but don't be shy about bringing your own games to share with the group if you think they might be a good fit. And don't worry if you haven't played a game before, we're always happy to teach new players.</p>
<p><span>A special shout out to our sponsor&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ggportland.com/">Guardian Games</a>,&nbsp;a purveyor of the finest of cardboard products, a strong supporter of the community, and a great place to check out the latest the game world has to offer.</span></p></hr> </html>

<p><span>Let's meet up for drinks and spiritual discussion in Portland's pubs. We're about questions and conversation and openness to diverse perspectives. The leaders are coming from Christian backgrounds and welcome all people to the table - "we need not think alike in order to love alike." Past topics have ranged from "what it means to live simply" to "how to deal with doubt and ambiguity."&nbsp;</span> <br></p>
<p><b>Who should join?</b></p>
<p>Spiritually open-minded folks looking to connect with others and explore the values that are important to them in a different way. An extensive knowledge of religious traditions is not required. To be fully engaged, you'll need r<span>espect, a willingness to share honestly, and the intention to grow spiritually.</span></p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>We hope to explore what fellowship looks like outside a church building, to be intentional in contemplating what we believe and passionate about living it out.</p></hr> </html>

I healed myself from depression (without drugs and without standard psychology) by understanding what I was doing to demonstrate depression and keep it alive, and a model of the 3 organizations of memory in the body. My physiology no longer elicits depression or anxiety--my highs are higher and my lows are higher. My healing was a product of a simple mindfulness practice and a unique model of science and spirit that includes cell-receptor biology, neuroplasticity, epigenetics, psycho-neuro-immunology, quantum physics, Law Of Attraction, energy-psychology. My influences have been the beautiful and energetic work of such science luminaries as Dr Joe Dispenza, Dr Bruce Lipton, Dr Candace Pert, Dr Norm Shealy, Dr Les Fehmi (Open Focus), and the discoveries and work of Gary Craig (creator of EFT), Donna Eden (Energy Medicine), Robert G. Smith (Faster EFT), and others. I have a work in progress, a concept called Positive Biology (visit positivebiology.com), that is my underlying philosophy and model about positive psychology, happiness, and peak experience. (Not a whole lot there yet, but stay tuned!) My new practice, now opening, is called A New Story (www.anewstory.net). Some potential Meetups include: DIY Begin To End Depression/Anxiety The Whole-Life Reboot (W-LR), W-LR and LOA (The Law Of Attraction) W-LR and How To Re-Invent Yourself (Hint: 1. Reboot the nervous system and 2. Experience and re-imagine life from a new positive biology and an open biological network.) Rex</p></hr> </html>

If the feeling that you have to quiet your mind or get a new religion before you learn to meditate has put you off, this class is for you. You won't have to empty your mind, sit on the floor, or have a new belief system to learn how to bring the many benefits of meditation into your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Classes are $10 to $15 per class, sliding scale. We'll be meeting at The Lincoln Street Church 5145 SE Lincoln @ Madison on Wednesday evenings from 6:45pm to 7:45 and at the Mad/50 Loft on 50th and Madison (the totem pole house at 1332 SE 50th) on <b>bi or tri monthly</b>&nbsp;Sunday mornings. (see calendar)</p>
<p>&nbsp;We'll have some instruction and then guided meditation in these two very nice settings. I'm a daily meditator who has had very good teachers and now I'm trained in teaching, too. I'm teaching at a transitional housing project in Portland, and have taught meditation to cancer and ALS patients and incarcerated individuals. I hope to broaden my teaching to underserved populations. I have a very keen interest in lessening the suffering in this world by teaching meditation and making it a simple, easy, and accessible for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The classes will be drop- in, on a rolling series schedule: whatever you didn't get last time will come back around again. I love beginners. I am very happy and excited to teach those who thought they couldn't meditate because of a busy mind or don't have a lot of experience meditating. I can make one guarantee: you will never regret learning how to meditate.</p>
<p>*This is not a silent meditation class or a Buddhist Sangha, in case that is what you are looking for.*</p>
<p>&nbsp;Classes will include body relaxation, focus on the breath, silent mantra, heart centered meditations, finding peace in the moment, contemplative meditations and instructions on how to bring the physical and mental benefits of meditation into your everyday life in multiple and simple ways. Hope to see you in class! I would would be happy to email with you, speak on the phone.

<p>The Spiritual Awakening Network is a discussion group and support network for those who have undergone a spiritual awakening or other spiritually transformative experience (such as mystical visions, the rising of&nbsp;Kundalini, or the dark night of the soul).

<p>We meet on the 2nd and 4th Mondays of each month to share our stories and discuss topics related to our spiritual awakenings and transformations in a compassionate and judgement-free environment. Our goal is to explore the deeper meanings of these experiences and to support ourselves and each other in integrating these changes into our lives in ways that support the continuing unfolding of our truest selves.</p></hr> </html>

However, simple doesn't always mean easy. It can be very helpful to have the support of a group and a teacher to navigate the challenges that arise in this practice. .

The belief is that when things happen that we interpret as negative that thought creates an energy disruption and that disruption gets stored in our energy system affecting us in various ways (emotionally, mentally, physically &amp;/or spiritually). So with this belief, EFT and other variations of meridian tapping are great tools to solve or dissolve blocks of all kinds that get in the way of living a great life.</p>
<p>If you have any issue (and who doesn't) that causes money, relationship, health or a whole host of other problems, then there is a good chance EFT can help you on the path to healing and often even resolve those issues.</p>
<p><br>

EFT is a non-invasive, drug free technique that has worked time and time again for thousands of people. It is catching on in the medical community with health practitioners and business and life coaches. Some Kaiser Permanente clinics are recommending EFT as a tool for patients.</p>
<p>For more information please visit: <a href="http://www.eftuniverse.com">www.eftuniverse.com</a>, or my website, <a href="http://www.andreacrisp.com">www.andreacrisp.com</a></p>
<p>In our Meetups we tap together on various issues to experience freedom and clarity about them. The group energy enhances the healing effects of EFT and everyone gets benefits, whether you volunteer or simply show up and tap along. You will find yourself in a safe and nurturing environment for growth and transformation. The Meetup may be a basic intro to EFT or on a specific topic, regardless, please join us!</p>

<p><span>Let's get together to talk about the questions we ask ourselves while getting dressed every day. Based on the book, </span><i><b>Women in Clothes</b></i><span>, (by ed. Heti, Julavits and Shapton) this group for discussing both deeply and light-heartedly how fashion choices go beyond presenting ourselves, looking pretty, or being advertised to...but rather meaningfully express and reflect our identities, intersecting with threads of family history, our identities as lovers, workers, mothers, creatives, private people. If you've ever been interested in fashion, or putting together outfits, but maybe feel ambivalent about the value of it, come participate with us!</span></p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/ACIM-Support-Group">A Course in Miracles Support Group</a></h2>for: <b>179</b> A Course In Miracles students<br><p>***Taking place every 2nd &amp; 4th Saturday of each month at 4:00 pm.- 5:45 pm in southeast Portland area near Belmont &amp; 55th**** I started A Course In Miracles (ACIM) group to create a space, in the central metro area of Portland, Oregon, for an egalitarian, participatory, deep exploration of the Course. This group involves personal sharing and supporting each other in understanding and practicing ACIM principles and teachings. The focus is on the ACIM forgiveness process. My perspective is aligned with Kenneth Wapnicks presentation and interpretation of the Course (he was a friend to Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford, during the completion period of the Course, and helped with them with the editing of the three volumes). The best way I can summarize what this group is about, is to say that my emphasis is on the gentleness of the Courses approach, as in this quote, Forgive is still and does nothing&It merely looks, and waits and judges not. All this is with an attitude of gentle kindness of heart. I do not consider myself any kind of advanced teacher. My desire is to share with others as an equal. My only qualifications are my love for ACIM and its process, my having read it through several times, and my having read many interpretations and given careful, intensive study of a great range of Course related materials, authors, books, talks, workshops, etc.. I invite and welcome those who are at least somewhat familiar with ACIM, who wish to deepen their understanding of its metaphysics, and learn to truly live its path in daily life.</p></hr> </html>

I am an LCSW therapist and coach with 20 years experience.

<p><b>The Structure of a Community Critique Group</b></p>
<p>A Community Critique Group consists of a submitting author, a facilitator, and up to six additional individuals, drawn from a pool of active members and Peoples Ink Observers (potential new members participating for the first time). The composition of each Community Critique Group is created taking into account requests, personalities, literary interests, attendance, and gender. Critique submissions can be in any genre, style, or format, and up to 10,000 words in length, though many submitting authors present fewer words. Submitting to the Community Critique Groups are attendance based meaning that for every 5 attendances in the Community Groups (critique, discussion, and writing groups), members are granted 1 Community Critique Group where they can submit their own writing for review.</p>
<p><b>The Structure of a Community Discussion Group</b></p>
<p>There are currently two Community Discussion Group offerings: The Writers Craft Discussion Group and the Literary Theory Discussion Group. The objective of a discussion group is not to critique writing submissions, but rather, to delve fully into literary topics&nbsp;for the edification of all discussion group participants. In the case of The Writers Craft Discussion Groups, the purpose is to grow our understanding of narrative and languagethe how of writing. In the case of The Literary Theory Discussion Group, the purpose is to explore theoretical philosophical topics and debate regarding their truth and efficacythe why of writing.'</p>
<p>The Writers Craft Discussion Group offers this rotating syllabus:</p>
<p>Discussion 1: Character</p>
<p>Discussion 2: Plot</p>
<p>Discussion 3: Language</p>
<p>Discussion 4: Voice</p>
<p>Discussion 5: Theme</p>
<p>Discussion 6: Surprise!</p>

<p>Discussion 10: Posthumanism in the Humanities</p>

<p><b>The Structure of a Community Writing Group</b></p>
<p>The Community Writing group entails a single activity: writing. Theres fun conversation and beer-drinking, certainly, but for the majority of the meeting, The Community Writing Group consists of quiet-time for members to focus on generating words on page. Its a great option for those who otherwise have difficulty finding time during their week for motivated writing sessions, as well as for those who are looking for a week off from workshopping, or who are just feeling inspired.</p>
<p><b>The Structure of a Focus Group</b></p>
<p>A Focus Group represents a higher level of commitment and seriousness than the typical Community Group. A Focus Group can be a critique group populated by particular kinds of writers seeking particular kinds of critiques; a long-lasting discussion group exploring a particular topic; a writing group that meet regularly for particular exercises; or any combination thereof. A Focus Groups structure is determined by its participants, including max submission lengths, schedule, submission scheduling, and the activities that occur during each meeting.</p>
<p>Examples of two Focus Group structures: (1)&nbsp;<span>The Manuscript Exchange Focus Group. Novels and long-form pieces only; 50,000 word count max per submission; meetings once every 4-5 weeks; meetings last 2-3 hours; attendance based (1 workshop for every 5 attendances). (2) The Short Form Focus Group. Short fiction/non-fiction; 5k word count max; meetings every other week; meetings last 1.5 hours; includes either two separate member submissions or one member submission and one discussion / writing exercise.</span></p>
<p><b>Offering a Critique</b></p>
<p>A critique consists of a verbal and / or written analysis of a critique group submission. The purpose of a critique is to provide the submitting author with insight regarding how the critique group submission might be improved. A critique group submission can be&nbsp;prose, poetry, an essay, a script, a piece of experimental writing, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p>Regardless the nature of the critique group submission, we ask that our members follow several guidelines when offering a critique.</p>
<p>- Contributions to the critique discussion should be based on a complete and close reading of the critique group submission. This is necessary in order to provide a deep analysis of the writing.</p>
<p>- Contributions to the critique discussion should be succinct and on topic. If you tend&nbsp;toward loquaciousness, please be mindful of allowing other members time&nbsp;to speak.</p>
<p>- Because sharing writing can be an intimate and possibly intimidating experience, contributions to the critique discussion should be offered with both sensitivity and tact. However, honesty is also important.&nbsp;It can be a fine line. When uncertain about which side to error upon, we request that you choose sensitivity and tact.</p>
<p>- Contributions to the critique discussion should take into account the style, genre, draft, and intention of the critique group submission. Taken together, these will determine much of what constitutes a useful contribution.&nbsp;Theres no one size fits all, and to approach the critique in such a way will inevitably lead to inferior and possibly useless contributions. If you feel insufficiently able to critique the writing you were assigned, please contact an administrator and your workshop assignment will be changed.</p>
<p>Please note, if a members contributions fail to adhere to the above guidelines, an administrator will be notified, and the offending member will be&nbsp;asked to reread these guidelines and to follow them more closely. If offenses are consistent and egregious, they may constitute grounds for expulsion from The Peoples Ink. In practice, few offenses occur, and those that do are typically harmless.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The following list contains acceptable critiques to offer at The Peoples Ink. This list is by no means exhaustive of whats acceptable, nor are all the lists items acceptable critiques for all critique group submissions. For more information about&nbsp;what qualifies as a acceptable critique, please request participation in The Writers Craft Discussion Group and/or The Literary Theory Discussion Group.</p>
<p>- Your reading experience. Is the submission difficult to read? Do the words create a vivid scenario in your mind? Do you skim in an effort to finish quickly? Do you delight in the language and hang on each word? Do you read the submission in one sitting, or over many?</p>
<p>- Your reader response. Do you like the submission? Do you dislike the submission? Why, or why not? What emotions do you experience when reading? Are these the emotions that the author intended, in your estimation? What are your favorite parts of the submission? Which parts are your least favorite<span>?</span></p>
<p><span>- Language. Do you find the literary style fascinating, evocative, poetic? Or do you find the literary style dull, dense, and confusing? Generally speaking, your analysis should take into account: (1) word choice, (2) punctuation, (3) rhythm, (4) transitions, (5) ambiance, (6) point of view, (7) and narrative voice, among other aspects of language. The more precisely you can analyze and deconstruct the writing submission into the components of its language usage, the more meaningful your suggestions will become.</span></p>
<p><span>- Narration. Do you find the narrative arc compelling? Or do you find it ineffective? Generally speaking, your analysis should take into account: (1) character, (2) plot, (3) action / tension / dramatic stakes, (4) comedic impact, (5) plot twists, (6) climax, and (7) resolution, among other aspects of narrative. As with language, the more precisely you can analyze and deconstruct the writing submission into its narrative components, the more meaningful your suggestions will become.</span></p>
<p><span>- Theme. What is the submissions message? Is this clear? Is it convincing? Is surprising or novel information conveyed? Is old information conveyed in a new way? Does it contribute meaningfully to conversations in its intended subject matter(s)?</span></p>
<p><span>- Symbolism. What symbols are present in the characters, events, and descriptions? How are they familiar, and how are they unfamiliar? How do they follow the conventions of the genre that they appear within, and how do they break those conventions? What do the symbols represent? What are their goals? Do they accomplish their goals?</span></p>
<p><span>- Commercial Considerations. Can you see a readership for the critique group submission? If yes, where might it find an audience? If not, how might the critique group submission become more commercial?</span></p>
<p><span>- Sociocultural. How might differing world cultures respond to the critique group submission? Are characters unintentionally stereotypical? Are characters presented with equality and without bias? What sort of sociocultural messages does the critique group submission convey? Would it have&nbsp;a positive impact upon the world? If so, how?</span></p>
<p><span>- Psychoanalytic. Does the critique group submission seem intentionally or unintentionally psychologically revealing of its author? Does the critique group submission serve a personal psychological goal of the writers? If so, is this apparent to the reader? Should it be?</span></p>

<p>Ive been in a handful of writing groups over the years, but nothing quite like the Peoples Ink. At first I was a little wary of joining such a large group. I figured the chemistry I had worked so hard to create with my smaller group would be missing here. I was wrong. The Peoples Ink is just a larger family. Best of all, you get out of it what you put in. There are so many opportunities between the various focus groups, manuscript exchanges and craft workshops. You can really tailor your experience based on your level of writing proficiency and where you are with your work. I recommend the Peoples Ink to anyone looking to link to a diverse community of writers.</p>
<p> Adam S.</p>
<p>This is an awesome writing group. Let me just put that out there to start. Ive been in several writing groups over the years in various cities, and The Peoples Ink is by far the best one Ive found. Its on par with the masters-level writing workshops I participated in during grad school. So yeah, its pretty bomb. There are so many wonderful people in the group with varying levels of experience, all genres are welcome, and its a really fun, warm bunch of writers. Whether you write short fiction, poetry, novels, or philosophy  seriously, whatever  youll find a place here. The feedback Ive received on my novel-in-progress has been insightful, enlightening, and invaluable. Ive yet to attend a meeting I didnt enjoy.</p>
<p> Meg S.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A bunch of writers, all of them working on different stuff, coming together each week, talking about each others work, helping each other make it better, watching projects develop over time, creating a sense of community. Writers across America  nay, the world!  wish they had this sort of group in their town. And it just so happens that we do.&nbsp;</p>

Or have you heard snippets of this "shared economy thing" and want to know if there is really something to it? Do you love it, hate it or question it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you like to learn and share creative ways to earn extra income, save money, and help others do the same using the things that you already own? If so, join our group to meet others using the "shared/ rental economy." There are literally dozens of new companies starting up each month, not to mention changing their names or shutting down, but it's hard to know which ones are worth trying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By meeting together, we can share the ones we like get answers to our questions, and make new friends with a common interest. No matter if you've been Couchsurfing since 2007 or just learned the term "Shared Economy" today, you are an early adopter, because this is just the beginning. We will have a happy hour meetup each month, hopefully sponsored by one of the many awesome companies out there.</p></hr> </html>
<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Empty-Nesters-NW">Empty Nesters NW</a></h2>for: <b>147</b> Empty Nesters<br><p>Our kids have flown the coop!  I'm Angela-45 &amp; my husband David-47.  We will have co-ed, women's only &amp; men's only &amp; even family activities.  Most activities will be centrally located for convenience for all OR &amp; SW WA members.</p>
<p>Who should join? Individuals or couples (married/unmarried), singles, soon to be or wish you were empty nesters.  People who haven't had children, adoptive &amp; step parents too.  You can even join us if you feel you should be an empty nester ha-ha (sometimes they don't move out right away).  Everyone from all walks of life &amp; ages are welcome. </p>
<p>We have all kinds of things planned from varying activities, interests, prices ranging from free to some more spendy things, indoor &amp; some outdoor.  We will probably start out with mostly movies, dinners, lunches, Food carts &amp; brunches, coffee times at first till we get rolling.  We'll have individual events &amp; re-occurring.  We will be trying to accommodate different schedules.  My husband works, so his time is limited, my schedule is a little more open. </p>
<p>Future activities could end up being: picnics, potlucks, bbq's, game nights, events, tours, outings, museums, walking, festivals, fairs, camping, day trips, shopping (outlets, resale, garage sales), kayaking, trivia, etc...<br>

<br>

We are looking forward to getting to know you &amp; having some of you be event organizers to do some of the things that maybe we aren't able to go do with our personal schedule, or doesn't fit to our interests...but would love for you to go have fun and do.  Like biking, hiking, antiquing, book club, happy hour, theater/plays, sports events, fishing, golfing, karaoke, crafts, scrapbooking, etc...<br>

(we personally don't drink, but others can set up those activities).</p>
<p>RSVP's are encouraged :-)  We will be able to check those up until the event starts, we will be contactable as well.  A few events are limited space available (with waiting lists), but most things are pretty flexible.</p>
<p>We haven't decided on membership dues, I like the idea of having a donation envelope at the events (to help aide in the cost of our membership fees, name tags, bbq supplies, etc...)</p>
<p>There will be events that you will incur costs (we will try to give you guys as much advance warning about those) such as: entrance or cover charges, parking, tipping (strongly encouraged).  Restaurants automatically add to checks a gratuity fee.  Make sure you don't tip them twice. :-)</p>
<p>This is not a networking club for promoting your business.</p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Dialogs">Dialogs</a></h2>for: <b>131</b> Discussants<br><p>Are you looking for thoughtful discussions?</p>
<p><i>Dialogs</i> is a multi-disciplinary group that promotes the exchange of ideas during reflective, analytic, and polite discussion. We hold conversations on topics ranging from the philosophical to the political, from science to art, from theology to mathematics, from computer science to social sciencewith consideration and good spirits all around. Our intention is to bring together those who are fascinated and diversely educated in order that we may all become more contemplative individuals.</p>
<p>We offer several discussion formats:</p>
<p><b>Open Discussion</b>: Modeled after the philosophical dialogues of Greek antiquity, we meet without an assigned topic so that participants may share their thoughts. Perhaps a troubling question becomes the topic of conversation, or a recent news article prompts inquiry. Please feel free to bring articles or copies of book excerpts, or to share a web-link in advance of our meeting. </p>
<p><b>Scheduled Topic</b>: Similar to the Open Discussion, except with more focus on a particular topic, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote> 
 <p>-Political and economic subjects such as: the TPP and the American economy, or white-collar automation; </p> 
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
 <p>-Philosophical investigations such as: free will and determinism, or the essence of linguistic meanings; </p> 
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
 <p>-Social matters such as: power and privilege in the structure of technology companies, or the implications of quantification in the social sciences; </p> 
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
 <p>-Historical topics such as: the creation of the post WWII world, or the rise of postmodernism in the arts;</p> 
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
 <p>-Religious topics such as: the spread of Islam in Africa, or Buddhisms influence in New Age religion.</p> 
</blockquote>
<p>Topics are assigned in advance and may be chosen for a variety of reasons. For example, perhaps the topic arose during an Open Discussion and participants wished for more depth. Another possibility is that a Dialogs member is knowledgeable about a particular topic they wish to introduce the community to. </p>
<p>Some discussions may require multiple meetings to cover in depth. There may be suggested readings, but usually not book-length.</p>
<p><b>Readings</b>: The most focused of all discussion types, Readings is an agreement among members to read a text in advance to a meeting in order to discuss it with depth. While it is not absolutely mandatory to have read the text in its entirety, it is highly recommended. (Sometimes it is not possible due to life circumstances. Even without reading, you are welcomed and encouraged to be thoughtfully present.) Reading lengths will vary from articles to papers to chapters to entire books.</p>
<p>As facilitator of <i>Dialogs</i>, I see my role as similar to that of a guide. Topics are like stops on a trail which may be viewed at a glance (a Wikipedia article, for instance), but which take time to explore their substance (to read all the information from which the Wikipedia article was distilled from). Humility in understanding depth and diversity is something I will bring to each conversation. I encourage others to do the same. To quote Socrates, The more I learn, the more I learn how little I know. There is beauty in the ineffable just as there is beauty upon the many wild paths we shall wonder.</p>
<p>On behalf of all of us at <i>Dialogs</i>, I would like to extend you a warm welcomewe look forward to meeting you soon.</p>
<p>In inquiry,</p>
<p>Derek</p></hr> </html>

<p style="text-align : justify">There have been some changes lately. The Gaura Nitai Center of Portland<span>&nbsp;has closed it's doors. Still we will be having classes, kirtan, and devotional events. Let me know if you would like to host an event by emailing me your thoughts and ideas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>What is Bhakti?</p>
<p>Bhakti is an ancient Sanskrit word which means Pure Love and Devotion. &ldquo;Pure&rdquo; implies that there is no adulteration or mixture of anything else. Love in its highest and most perfect state must be entirely pure and devoid of any other desire than to give happiness and benefit to the beloved, the object of one&rsquo;s love, Krsna.</p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/runemysteries">Runes And Other Northern Mysteries</a></h2>for: <b>124</b> seekers<br><p>PLEASE NOTE: &nbsp;IF YOU REQUEST MEMBERSHIP YOU NEED TO HAVE A PICTURE ON YOUR MEETUP PROFILE. &nbsp;THAT MEANS A PICTURE OF YOU, NOT YOUR DOG OR THE MOON OR ART WORK. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose and intention of this group is to form a community of people who are interested in the spiritual teachings and practices of the people of Northern Europe, Scandinavia and the British Isles prior to the Romans and the spread of Christianity.&nbsp; I offer gatherings that are centered around a study of the runes.&nbsp; We have drum circles where we drum to remember our ancestors.&nbsp; We gather to do ritual and honor the changing of the seasons and the turning of the wheel.</p>
<p>Rune Study:&nbsp; The runes are more than an alphabet.&nbsp; They are an ancient system of symbols that connect us, on a vibrational level, elemental level to the ancestors, the earth, and all the beings, seen and unseen.&nbsp; I organize gatherings series of discussions and teaching on the individual runes.&nbsp; I also give presentations and lectures about the runes and invite people to come listen, learn and ask questions.</p>
<p>Drum Circles:&nbsp; Drums are alive.&nbsp; They are as individual as we are.&nbsp; When we drum we connect with the spirit of the wood, the spirit of the animal, the spirit of the drum maker and the spirit that is the drum itself.&nbsp; Drumming connects us to the heart beat of the Earth and the lower vibrations that are so necessary for us as humans. It also connects us to the first sound we hear as humans, the beat of our mother's heart. Drumming can be used to do shamanic journey work, to alter our consciousness and allow us to travel between the worlds. Many of us have forgotten that drumming was part of the daily lives of the indigenous people of Old Europe and the British Isles so when we drum in the Northern tradition it is a powerful way for us to reconnect with the forgotten spirituality of these European and British Isle ancestors, their gods, their spirits, their sagas and their wisdom. The group is open to all who are interested in the power and spirit of drumming however <strong>we only play hoop/frame drums with natural animal hides.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Monthly Kith and Kin Gatherings</strong></p>
<p>These take place most months on the 3rd Sunday. &nbsp;We gather at the homes of various people in the group. &nbsp;It is potluck. &nbsp;Sometimes there is a theme for the food. &nbsp;We always have a topic that we discuss. &nbsp;We drum. &nbsp;We eat and drink. &nbsp;We share. &nbsp;It's about families, community, fun, connection and friendship. &nbsp;Kith and Kin is by invitation only either by someone in the group or by the organizer. &nbsp;It is usually best for someone to come to a drum circle or class first to get a sense of who we are and what we are about. &nbsp;However that isn't always necessary. &nbsp;Check in with the coordinator if you have questions.</p>
<p>On occasion we also do rituals. &nbsp;Rituals are special events honoring the seasons and the turning of the wheel of life and are custom designed as I am directed by the ancestors, the spirits and the gods.</p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Portland-Survivors-of-Suicide-Social-Meetup-Group">Portland Survivors of Suicide Social Support Meetup Group</a></h2>for: <b>109</b> Survivors<br><p>After my wife committed suicide in March of 2011 I started attending suicide bereavement groups and counselling sessions attempting to work through the life shattering tragedy that was her death. I found it difficult or impossible to talk about this with friends and family or anyone who hasn't experience the loss of a loved one to suicide. I also found it difficult to get out and do the things I used to enjoy or to meet new people without feeling disassociated and uneasy. I have found, through the bereavement groups, that there is an instant connection to those who have suffered the same type of loss; who speak to and understand what it truly feels like. While the groups are very helpful, they are also very emotionally charged, structured and infrequent. The purpose of this group is to create a social forum, where survivors of suicide can build support networks with fellow survivors while getting out in a safe but social setting. This group is for anyone who has lost a loved one to suicide and is looking for fellow survivors for support and to support. If you are prepared to support and be supported and committed to working through the bereavement process then this group may be for you. **This is not an organized bereavement group led by a trained grief counselor.**</p></hr> </html>

</p>
<p>Teens and grads from the 70's and 80's, let's find each other and have some fun!</p>
<p>Don't worry, members can still bring guests from any wonderful generation to events.  Any friend of yours is a friend of ours.<br>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Women-of-the-always">Women Of The Always - Exploring Dark Moon Wisdom</a></h2>for: <b>105</b> wise women<br><p><span><b>Women of the Always</b> was created as a way to form community, to gather together women who are passionate, fierce and courageous. &nbsp;Women who&nbsp;</span>want to explore, study and discuss our own innate wisdom. &nbsp;We've often been disconnected from it because it's been hidden, forbidden, and in some cases, all but forgotten.</p>
<p><span><b>Why Dark Moon?</b> &nbsp;Because the nature of the moon is dark. &nbsp;She doesn't shine, she reflects and there are times during every month when the moon is dark in the night sky, reflecting nothing, just being herself. &nbsp;As women, our connection with the moon is ancient and primal and we remember in our bodies what it's like to be ourselves, not reflecting anyone else's light.</span></p>
<p>"<b>&nbsp;<span>Lively discussions, usually controversial</span></b></p>
<p><b>"&nbsp;Thought-provoking questions designed to inspire</b></p>
<p><b>"&nbsp;Sharing of food and drink</b></p>
<p><b>"&nbsp;Building meaningful connections and lasting friendships</b></p>
<p><b>"&nbsp;Creating sacred altars</b></p>
<p><b>"&nbsp;Enjoying rituals</b></p>
<p><b>"&nbsp;Guided meditations</b></p>
<p><span>I charge for gatherings because of the nature and content and the amount of work and preparation I put into each one of them. &nbsp;When you pay and attend you receive a pdf. file of the material we use in class. &nbsp;I also offer what I call a<a href="http://www.ingridkincaid.com/dark-moon-initiation.html"> Women of the Always Dark Moon Intensive</a> which includes the 26 topics, personal coaching, intuitive guidance and monthly group conference calls. &nbsp;There are more details on my website and a <i>Application For Consideration</i> as well.</span> <br></p>
<p><span>You must be willing to explore, question and participate in discussions of topics that are challenging and perhaps disturbing and most&nbsp;</span>definitely politically incorrect.</p>
<p><span>I create a safe circle in which this can occur as well as a place where you can bring your own questions and feelings.&nbsp;Many women who have come to these circles have expressed how happy they are to have a safe space to talk about and discuss things they feel but never want to share.</span> <br></p>
<p>Please note that I market these gatherings in a variety of places so the count here on meetup may not reflect the actual number of women attending. &nbsp;I also feature other events on the site that I think might be interesting to the women who are members here.</p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/The-Portland-Colloquium">The Portland Colloquium</a></h2>for: <b>97</b> Artists, Thinkers, and Activists<br><p>We're The Portland Colloquium.</p>
<p>We host conversations about the creative and liberal arts, including how they intersect with philosophy, psychology, culture, economics, and education. Here are some example topics: The Economics of University Education in the Creative and Liberal Arts; Artistry in Contemporary Times; and Defining a Personal Expressive Lineage. In advance to our meetings, well provide prompts and electronic resources (optional reading); and during our meetings, well provide conversational structure and facilitation. We want to gather thoughtful people together for enlightening conversation about the creative and liberal arts, and create an enjoyable way to spend a Thursday evening.</p>
<p>We're also interested in organizing a non-profit that aspires to offer free, inclusive, structured, and community-based education. Below, you can read about what's inspired us: our Tenets, our Cultural and Educational Philosophy, our Educational Model, and a brief analysis regarding The Economics of Creativity. Parts of these documents will occasionally serve as starting points for our Thursday conversations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We have a long way to go before the non-profit comes to fruition, so in addition to hosting conversations, were hoping to use this meetup to connect with other artists, participants, organizers, and activists who might want to become involved with a non-profit dedicated to offering creative and liberal arts education.</span> <br></p>
<p>We look forward to meeting!</p>
<p>______________________________________________________________________________________________ <br> <br></p>
<p>Cultural and Educational Philosophy</p>
<p>The following ideas have inspired our educational model. We believe that taken together they imply a viable way to foster and perpetuate the many traditions of creative arts, liberal arts, artistry, and thoughtful reflection.</p>
<p>- Cultural Critical Mass. Our society is replete with informed and talented individuals who are able to inspire and guide one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Mutual Empowerment. Solitary effort in the form of observation, study, practice, and reflection is a foundation for growth; it's supported by community interaction in the form of discussion, critique, sharing, and networking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Educational Ecosystem. Our critiques, discussions, and activity groups are like seedsthey grow into verdure through participation, wilt through loss of interest, return to soil through a lack of participation, and fertilize the next round of educational offerings through inspiration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Decentralized Curriculum. Given varying cultural influences, personalities, values, and interests, combined with the scope of all possible inquiries and experiences, each individual should necessarily study a personalized curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Progressions, Not Products. Development doesnt end at an age, with an accomplishment, or upon earning a degree; its ongoing over a lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Personal Expressive Lineages. Each of us bears a personal expressive lineage created from expressions we love, and tempered by those we dont.</p>
<p>- The Expressive Singularity. There is more expression in the world today than any single individual can hope to become familiar with, and its being added to moment-by-moment, explosively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- The Expressive Self. Contemporary personalities are a result of the expressions in which they encounter and personalize.</p>
<p>- The Expressive Society. Contemporary society is a result of the expressions it produces and endorses. <br>______________________________________________________________________________________________ <br> <br></p>
<p>Tenets.</p>
<p>The Portland Colloquium is free, inclusive, structured, and community-based.</p>
<p>- Free. Attendance and participation costs no money, ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Inclusive. Anyone committed to participation in the group format(s) of their choosing and who purports themselves with kindness and good faith, is welcome.</p>
<p>- Structured. We provide clear expectations and thoroughly coordinated group planning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Community. We unite people in the spirit of support, collaboration, and learning. <br>______________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p> <br>Educational Model</p>
<p>For an example of the kind of educational communities we wish to create, view the website for The People's Ink--a community for creative writers and poets--at Peoples-ink.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our model has five parts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Critique Groups.&nbsp;During a critique, a member submits creative material (i.e., a short story, a painting, or a song) and receives analytical feedback on the material. A critique group is composed of a submitting artist, a discussion facilitator, and up to six additional attendees who are active in and knowledgeable about the medium under discussion. Critiques should present the submitting artist with suggestions on revisions and completion, as well as a structured response to the work.</p>
<p>- Discussions. The objective of a discussion group is to explore a specific topic either related to the 'how to' of the&nbsp;artistic craft, or&nbsp;academic, theoretical, or philosophical topics related to the arts. &nbsp;Previous examples include "Character in Fiction", Color Composition in Painting", "Rock Song Basics",&nbsp;"Female Archetypes in Fiction," "Modernism and Postmodernism," and "Punk Rock Aesthetic," There is room for expert and novice alike to participate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Activity Groups.&nbsp;Activity groups unite people for a shared activity. Participants may remain independent as they perform the activity (i.e., creative writing where each participant writes a separate story), or may perform a shared activity (i.e., creative writing where each participant writes based on a prompt, and then shares aloud). While focused productive time is a major goal of any activity group, time is allowed for verbal exchange and banter as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Lectures. A lecture involves a guest-speaker or community member with expertise on on a topic to present. As with discussion groups, lectures can be either craft-based and "how to," or theory-based about a particular subject. Example topics include, "Self-Publishing in the Electronic Age," "Beyond Google: Research on the Internet," and "Grassroots Community Organizing." Lectures either involve a single session or a series of sessions, and typically last about an hour plus Q&amp;A.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Exhibitions and Special Events. Exhibitions and special events happen irregularly. They are typically in support of our educational offerings, may not be educational in themselves. Exhibitions include readings, art shows, and concerts, where community members can showcase their talents. Special events are designed to further the careers of our community members, and usually consist of contests and blank. &nbsp;</p>
<p> <br>______________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p> <br>The Economics of Creativity and Thoughtfulness</p>
<p>Should there be a new manner in which our city and society offers education in the creative and liberal arts? The following economic trends have brought us to wonder.</p>
<p>Education Economics. <br>- University programs in the creative and liberal arts are steeply priced, and the costs are only rising. <br>- So far, the best alternative to costly university programs has been costly institutional programs such as non-degree granting programs and independent workshops. <br>- Many pursue education in the creative and liberal arts in order to explore their creative artistry and to learn about themselves and the world they live in, not in order to earn a living in an unrelated profession, though this is often what follows with graduation.</p>
<p>Income and Career Economics. <br>- Graduates in the creative and liberal arts report poor earnings, and there's plenty of statistical and anecdotal evidence to suggest degrees in these fields are becoming less financially viable. <br>- Career opportunities in the fields of the creative and liberal arts are dwindling, and theres fierce competition for what does exist. <br>- The creative arts are being demonetized by electronic mediums of distribution and piracy; historically, a career in the creative arts hasnt been lucrative for most, while many achieved fame and success posthumously.</p>
<p>Other Economics. <br>- Debt levels held by the public are rising public (student loans, credit card, mortgage, car, etc.). <br>- The cost of living is rising (food prices, rental costs, child-rearing expenses, etc.). <br>- The middle class is shrinking and its wages are stagnant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Portland is filled with people who want to learn about the creative and liberal arts, but might be prevented from doing so given the above economic considerations. For this reason, we believe its right for alternative education models&nbsp;<span>to arise.</span></p>
<p>Given our esteem for art, creativity, and reflective thought, we believe education in the creative and liberal arts should be considered a right, not a privilege, especially not a privilege that each year fewer can afford. Our aspiration is to provide high quality educational environments.&nbsp; <br>______________________________________________________________________________________________ <br> <br></p></hr> </html>
<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Present-Moment-Play">Present Moment PDX</a></h2>for: <b>96</b> Members<br><p>There's lots of talk these days about the present moment, or the Now, and how to get there. Teachers like Eckhart Tolle and Byron Katie each have great ways to help us get there, but rarely do we have an opportunity to be together with others to just practice and play with being present.</p>
<p>Under all our thinking, and movement in the world, lays our true Self, which is love and presence. The intent of this group is to allow our Selves to shine through by supporting each other in staying present with what is actually happening right now. By keeping stories about the past and future to a minimum, and sticking with the experience we're having now, our minds can relax, and allow our authentic being to shine into our awareness. There is no technique to learn, or discipline to master, just a coming back to ourselves, and telling the truth all the way through. It's immensely helpful to do this with the support of others doing the same. Allowing yourself to be seen, and seeing others, in presence, allows the love we already are to blossom more fully into our everyday experience.</p>
<p>The meetups will start with some basics about confidentiality and compassion (this encourages a sense of safety and supports people in speaking directly about their feelings in the moment). <br>Then we'll jump in. This may include speaking directly to your present-moment feelings (fear, excitement, anger, etc) or "telling on yourself" about a story you are making up in your mind about some person in the room, or how someone's words or behavior are triggering a reaction in you. <br>Speaking to these stories and projections is often the fastest way to see through the false separation that they cause.. Then connection, clarity, and real intimacy show up spontaneously.</p>
<p>A $10-20 donation is requested. This goes towards use and maintenance of the meeting space as well as administrative costs.</p></hr> </html>

<p>Through online discussions and monthly meetings we hope to support fellow members of the group in their fundraising initiatives and learn ways to diversify our fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, this meetup is about helping people create community and learn about fundraising.</p>
<p>This meetup is not a place for people looking to get money from its members. This is a promotion-free zone. If you are a "network marketer" or want to tell people to donate to your campaign, please do not join this group. We are here for professional development only.</p>
<p>We will cover topics such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting more sponsors</li>
<li>Writing a better appeal letter</li>
<li>Donor stewardship strategies</li>
<li>Finding new donors</li>
<li>How to get people to open your e-newsletter</li>
<li>Crowdfunding</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nonprofit interview skills</li>
<li>Cover letter review</li>
<li>Salary negotiation techniques</li>
<li>Social media jobhunting techniques</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also look at different fundraising books, for example, Joyaux &amp; Ahern's Keep Your Donors, or The Accidental Fundraiser by Roth &amp; Ho.</p>
<p>We will invite guest speakers on major gifts, prospect research, capital campaigns, planned giving, etc, and ask community members to speak as well.</p>
<p>The Portland Professional Fundraiser and Grantmaker Meetup Group is for anyone currently working, studying, or transitioning into nonprofit fundraising and grantmaking positions.</p>
<p>We look forward to our members using this site organization to promote a global network of like-minded sites by individuals who will help each other to advance their professional education, provide mentoring, and strengthen their professional associations.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, we hold Portland Oregon-based networking events; encourage members to develop one-on-one professional contacts; and, provide professional development mentoring.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you soon!</p></hr> </html>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Womens-Theology-Hub">Women's Theology Hub</a></h2>for: <b>88</b> Members<br>Wrestling with what the Bible says about women.  Some of us have grown up in the nurturing comfort of church and Sunday School.  Some of us did not find a place of welcome once we grew up.  Some of us have been quoted verses from the Bible about the role of women in the church and society.  Some of us are left with more questions than answers.  If God loves me, and other folks of my gender, why do I feel like a second-class citizen?  What is there for me to do in the church?  And if not in the church, where?  Why is it that sometimes the Bible stories make it sound like women dont count for much?
If these, or questions like them have troubled you, then you may want to sit with some others to wrestle with what Scripture says about women.  Who knows?  Maybe you will find some kindred spirits and someone to share the journey, all wrapped up with learning some cool new stuff with a bunch of fun people!</hr> </html>

<p>We will alternate between doing art and craft nights one Sunday a month and an afternoon of writing on the other.</p> 
<p>Art Nights: House opens at 6:30. Short ritual at 7. Over at 9. I may have some supplies but you should plan on bringing your own projects and supplies.</p> 
<p>Writing Afternoons: House opens at 1:30. Ritual at 2. Bring your notebook and pen. We will write together from prompts more with the idea of sparking creativity and having a shared experience more than creating finished work. Not a critiquing environment. Goes until 4.</p> 
<p>Optional things to bring to both: items for the altar including a small offering, an object or artistic implement to bless, an object that represents your muse or divine inspiration. A vegan food or drink to share. Words of inspiration, songs or affirmations you want included in the ritual.</p></hr> </html>

<p>National Novel Writing Month (nanowrimo.org)</p>
<p>National Novel Editing Month (nanoedmo.net)</p>
<p>ScriptFrenzy (scriptfrenzy.org)</p>
<p>WriYe (Formerly National Novel Writing Year) (<a href="http://www.wriye.co.nr">www.wriye.co.nr</a>)</p>
<p>November is National Novel Writing Month, when a bunch of crazy people attempt to write a 50,000 word novel in 30 days, but more about that at <a href="http://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank"></a><a href="http://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">http://nanowrimo.org</a>.*</p>
<p>We offer regularly scheduled write-ins around Portland and environs year-round. Money raised through Portland NaNo will support 1) hosting of Portland NaNo at meetup.com, and 2) event expenses for Portland region events surrounding and during NaNoWriMo. Dues are $5 annually, with a 90 day free trial.</p>
<p>The purpose of the site is to encourage people to write. Most of us need a little motivation to write. Saying you will be at a certain place at a certain time - it helps us show up and do the work.</p>
<p>Read through the posted meetups on our calendar and find one that fits what you want to do - then commit to going and working. <span>If nothing on the calendar works for you, post your own meetup.</span></p>
<p>Get out there and WRITE!</p>

Baptism, Illumination, Self-Realization and Ordination are Solar Initiations that are available to all who give their lives in selfless service to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Mother/Father Creator&nbsp;through our Master Christ Jesus. There is&nbsp;a Universal Path of Initiation into the&nbsp;Christ-ian Mysteries known as The Way.&nbsp; To follow It is to become a <strong>Servant Of the Way.</strong></span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="color : #ae3333"><em><span style="font-size : small">The following gives an overview of what the various meetups will be about. &nbsp;You can also find informative topics by clicking the Pages tab above.&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of&nbsp;recommended links can be found by clicking on "Files" under the More tab.</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align : center"><strong><span style="font-size : small">ABOUT <span style="text-decoration : underline">SERVANTS OF THE WAY</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size : small"><span style="color : #ff0000">&ldquo;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."</span> (John 14:5-7)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : small">This passage has been the cause of great confusion amongst sincere seekers of Truth and the source of much harm inflicted by those who have used this statement as an excuse for exclusivity and superiority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : small">This statement was made by the <strong><span style="color : #333399">Cosmic Christ</span></strong> through the Master, Jesus.&nbsp; This Christ is the only begotten Son/Sun of God and is not the property of any one religion or philosophy.&nbsp; Followers of the Christ predate the 2000+ year history of what most people think of as &ldquo;Christianity&rdquo;.&nbsp; <strong><span style="color : #333399">As such, the WAY is Universal and Eternal.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : small">The WAY is the path of cosmic initiations that bring the initiate ever closer to the God Being Within.&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration : underline">This Great Self is all there is.</span></strong>&nbsp; There is nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : small">Although the WAY&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration : underline">is</span> universal it has been accessible through many religions or through various mystery schools over the thousands of years of man&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; These unique paths have been made available to humanity so each unique soul could find a path that specifically resonated with them at a given time in the soul&rsquo;s journey from lifetime to lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : small">It is important that each seeker find that path that speaks to them, that feels like home.&nbsp; By aligning themselves with a specific path they avail themselves of the spiritual transmission and transformative power of that path.&nbsp; Once they discover the Light within and have seen Self they can then see and know just how true are the words <span style="color : #333399">&ldquo;All is One&rdquo;</span> and can fully appreciate the spiritual golden thread that runs through all paths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : small">In the meantime it is important for the seeker to stay focused on their Teacher and path and fully absorb the transmission of Light, Life and Love that will bring them to the Realization of Self and God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : small">It is the purpose of <strong><span style="color : #333399">Servants Of the WAY</span></strong> to make available the very specific teachings and transformative power of Christ Jesus.&nbsp; This path is known by various names including <strong>The Ancient Mystery Teachings, Hermetic Teachings, Grail Mysteries, Gnostic Christianity and&nbsp; Esoteric/Mystical Christianity</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size : small"><strong><span style="color : #333399">Servants Of the WAY</span></strong> is <strong>not</strong> a group or organization.&nbsp; There is nothing to join.&nbsp; There is no charge for the work we do.&nbsp; It is a source of Initiation into the WAY.&nbsp; We only wish to share the experiences we have gained over several decades of inner initiatory work and bring others into the <span style="color : #333399"><strong>WAY of Service</strong></span> .&nbsp; The need is great.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color : #ff0000"><span style="font-size : small"><em><span style="text-decoration : underline">This Meetup is for you IF you are serious about allowing the Spirit and Light to transform and liberate you so that you can enter the great Work of Serving all Beings.</span></em><br>

<p><strong>Portland Patrons of the Arts (PPOA) is a group of art enthusiasts who live in Portland. We promote Cultural and Creative Arts &amp; Music. Your membership will give you the exclusive experience with PPOA discounts from our&nbsp;group Sponsors&nbsp;for Art and Theater events ranging from&nbsp;20% to 25%.</strong></p>
<p><b>"Our mission is to awaken love for art through an intimate experience of its various expressions, and thereby inspiring enthusiastic support for our Art Community."</b></p>
<p>The Art Patron is anyone interested in supporting, planning and attending arts and cultural events. I started this group to share my love of art and music and to help promote and support our community of young artists. Sadly I will be leaving Portland, but will continue managing a chapter of PPOA in Springfield, Missouri beginning 2016. However, I have recently transferred the PPOA meetup to our member and my friend, Audrey Romeo. Audrey is a lover of the arts and though a recent transplant from NYC, has learned about and participated in PPOA activities and a number of other meetup events that focus on the arts. She has organized meetups to theater events and currently leads a book club, which she will transfer to PPOA.</p>
<p>She too, believes that Portland is the most vibrant, dynamic, creative, and supportive of its artists. Audrey is looking forward to organizing events for current PPOA members and in meeting new Patrons of the Arts.</p>
<p>We started out with free membership&nbsp;and will return to that model of experiencing events &nbsp;together. Our goal is to be able to provide our Art Patrons with affordable experiences with a personal touch. PPOA will ask for contributions for the meetup website annual cost (any amount you can afford) and for the member to purchase his or her own ticket to an event that has a cost. However, the organizer will arrange to have seats together held, within a window of time, to insure that members have the opportunity to sit together during an event. We will also continue to set up a meeting place before or after the event, dependent on its timing. Happy hours are always an option before an event and the late happy hours that Portland restaurants provide work well for post-event gatherings.</p>
<p>We will collaborate with other art meetup groups on occasion and will always have a hosted event (barring any emergencies).) We will continue to strive to provide the best savings for our events. Our sponsors hopefully will continue to provide discounts that range from 20% to 25% for groups of 10 or more members. Audrey will always look for the opportunity of other discounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our rules of membership will continue. A new member must be approved by an organizer after he or she completes the online form, agrees to our terms of decorum and treating others in a friendly manner, promises to update RSVPs in a timely fashion and provide a current photo of his or her face; no cartoons or pets or scenes.&nbsp; PPOA does not allow members to promote their own business ventures on our site at any time, nor any reposting of our events on other sites except when one of our organizers (Audrey or Natcharee) arranges to collaborate with another group for a specific event. Members may not &nbsp;use the PPOA site for anything except RSVPs, appropriate comments and/or questions about an event or suggestions for an art event that is in line with our mission (second paragraph above).&nbsp; PPOA organizers have the right to remove from membership, anyone who disrupts an event or makes inappropriate comments to another member.</p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/creative-artists-way">Ransom Note Creativity - Set Yourself Free</a></h2>for: <b>69</b> creative explorers<br><p><span>You don't need to be a writer, or an artist to join in our fun, feisty, fabulous group.  All you need is a sense of humor, a willingness to explore and a longing to have your life be more creative.</span></p>
<p>Do you long to open doors and windows to creativity?  Would you like to find ways to reconnect with your well of imagination, with your passion, your dreams? Then come join us each week as we explore and create.</p>
<p>As the organizer, I am always creating and designing new offerings.  We've worked through books such as The Artist's Way, Walking In This World, Stoking The Creative Fires and Marry Your Muse.  We've made collages, read poetry, colored, completed all sorts of creative projects.  We've quit jobs, changed careers, bought and sold houses, wrote books, made videos, baked cakes and drank a lot of wine and beer.  We are a group who laugh and cry together, share and support.</p>
<p>You don't need any experience or credentials to join us. Just a willingness to explore and have fun. Several of the people who come to our gatherings and classes are not members of Meetup so the size of the group is often more than shown on the RSVP list.</p>
<p>Contact me personally if you have any questions. Ingrid@IngridKincaid.com</p>
<p>Here's a bit of my personal story and experience with creativity.</p>
<p>Back in 1992 my creativity was being held captive by all sorts of things:  doubt, fear, exhaustion, lack of support, depression, lack of time, you name it.  A friend of mine invited me to join a class that was based on the newly published book by Julia Cameron, 'The Artist's Way.'   I began a daily writing practice she called Morning Pages and I must say it truly saved my life, my sanity and my creativity. I have written my way through numerous moves, travel, divorce, interesting relationships, death and all manner of life in between. Writing has been my constant companion along the way.</p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Loved-ones-affected-by-Borderline-Personality-Disorder-BPD">Loved ones affected by BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder)</a></h2>for: <b>63</b> loved ones<br><p>**In the beginning phases of this group, as long as the group isn't too large, people with loved ones that are dealing with other personality disorders other than BPD are welcome to be involved with the group. If we get too many people, maybe someone else can start off a splinter group for other personality disorders.** </p>
<p>I'd like to have a group that meets to help support each other through the difficulties of having a loved one (family or friend or significant other) with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). I am not a professional nor do I play one on tv. ha-ha. I just want a very informal environment where we gather a minimum of monthly to be able to talk about what we're going through without feeling like others will be turned off by the reality of what we're talking about and going through. There are so many people I can't talk about this subject with. It would be nice to have an environment where it's ok to talk openly about it. </p>
<p>Some months there will be a loose topic suggested but not strictly followed and other months it might just be completely whatever. </p>
<p><strong>I take the safety and security of this group seriously. I require&nbsp;you use an alias for this particular group to protect your identity from hurting the feelings of your loved ones. I personally am using an alias for that very reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not use your real name.&nbsp; Please do not put a picture on your profile.&nbsp; Even if you feel safe with them not finding you on the group; I do not feel safe as the group leader because some of your loved ones could potentially start harassing me as the group owner.&nbsp; This kind of thing happens a lot.</strong></p>
<p>Also, in the interest of security and safety of the group. I would like to get to know each one of you a little bit before having you attend the group if possible. When I was considering starting up this group-I was warned by many people that the biggest challenge with this group would be people who actually have BPD could potentially try to join the group for a variety of reasons. One of my loved ones actually warned me of this as well that she herself would be tempted to join the group for fun and entertainment reasons. So I will develop a questionnaire. </p>
<p>**People who have been diagnosed with or likely could be diagnosed with a personality disorder of any type might want to find a different group that they would feel more comfortable in.** </p>
<p>I'm looking forward to getting to know each other, </p>

Well I got you covered. I love to teach the world to create. I have been involved in the art of rubber stamping for over 20yrs. There is more to do with rubber stamps then just stamping on paper.

I stamp on everything. The cost of the projects is cheap. I only charge for materials. Generally $2.50 a project. I always include light refreshments at every event. I can include other crafts like stepping stones and painting flower pots at the request of the group. &nbsp;I limit my meetup member size to only 50. &nbsp; If you want to join and my group is full apply anyway. &nbsp; I can work with you if you want to be an active member of this group. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></hr> </html>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Portland-Voice-Over-Meetup">Portland Voice Over Meetup!</a></h2>for: <b>41</b> VO Talents<br><p>Welcome to Portland Voice Over Meet Up.&nbsp; This is an opportunity for voice over people in the Portland area to get together to talk about the scene, how to get started, what &nbsp;the opportunities are, etc.&nbsp; We meet twice a month at the Lucky Labrador in NW Portland, a place that offers good conversations, good food, and good beer. &nbsp;Since there are monthly administrative cost for maintaining a group through meetup.com, we ask each member to donate $1 when attending our gatherings. &nbsp;Members who have not attended at least 4 meetings without RSVPing one way or the other will be removed from the roster. &nbsp;Simply put, the more members in the group, the higher the monthly administrative cost with meetup.com.</p></hr> </html>

Taught by Jena Viemeister (MM in Opera- Boston Conservatory 14), Divergent Opera offers Private Voice Lessons to all ages and abilities as well as a FREE Vocal Meditation Class every Thursday at 7pm.

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/PDX-Womens-Empathy-Network">PDX Women's Empathy Network</a></h2>for: <b>40</b> Members<br><p>Do you feel isolated and alone with pain or sickness? Or do you just wish you had a friend you could call on, anytime of the day or night? Do you bemoan the fact that people may text or email these days, but they rarely are able to drop everything and go sit with a sick friend to offer comfort? Well, I do. I want to form a network of local women who do just that--take care of each other. My goal is for us each to have at least 5 women we can contact at a moment's notice, if we're sick or scared or just need a friend, who will offer genuine compassion. I suffer from chronic pain and illness, and I have as much need to give as to receive such care. Let's start a community of nurturing, caring women! I will set up a first meetup once enough folks have expressed interest.</p></hr> </html>

You know what can be hard in this life? [or is it just Portland?]... Finding people who are nonduality-literate and passionate about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;down for a great meal or tea-type break [sourced for minimal karmic and toxin load, of course] have a solid sense of humor -&nbsp;take themselves lightly [as in aren't looking to preach to an audience], and perhaps suspect that a nonduality social group is entirely illogical... Well, maybe this group is for you. If none of us meet, well, it's just back to the normal disjointed life for me! [aspiring teachers/sanctimonious/pundit types please - form your own meetup - if this proves to be a satsang it is to be a Collective one]</p></hr> </html>

Sooner or later, such a religion will emerge."</em> ...Carl Sagan<span style="font-size : xx-small">*</span></p>
<p style="text-align : center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SolSeed Movement is an alternative to traditional religions. We embrace the scientific method and eschew magical thinking of all flavors. No UFOs. No homeopathy. No conspiracies. No psi powers. No miracles. No superstition. No supernatural. No paranormal. We adopt the cosmology provided by science and find meaning in "bringing life". SolSeed is about supporting each other in living the highest quality lives we can create, and more broadly it is about supporting and nurturing all of Life, helping it thrive and grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hold weekly services that celebrate the upward spiral of life, and weekly work bees that allow us to contribute to life in creative ways that would be unavailable to us if we didn't deliberately step outside the rat race. &nbsp;Our most significant events occur around the changes in the season, and often include a several-day reflective retreat held at a beautiful location in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research shows we are happiest when connected to others and working toward a cause that is greater than ourselves. SolSeed is simply one experiment in how to live this way without giving up reason and autonomy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We get to pick the future we are living for. &nbsp;Let's not pick the one in which we destroy ourselves and our tiny ocean planet. &nbsp;Instead, let's pick the one in which we come to deeply appreciate the body of all life that supports us and instead of killing it, we help it give birth to a family of living worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align : center"><em>The sky calls to us. &nbsp;If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to the stars.</em> --Carl Sagan</p>

<p>The idea is for a minimum of four women to meet up in the Hawthorne District at 9 or 10 in the morning, carpool to to a beautiful location for a moderately paced (walking) 5-12 mile brown bag hike (non-drivers each contribute $5 to driver for fuel and $1 to the group for Meetup fees). &nbsp;</p>
<p>We can chat about (secular) writing or creative projects when meeting up, driving out, and (optionally) during the lunch/rest break. But actual hiking will be silent to allow for contemplation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: this will not be an athletic pace, but you need to be fit enough to walk steadily for several miles with some occasional hills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in July 2015.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Contact me if you'd like to get something specific on the calendar!&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. &nbsp;Apologies are due to inspirational, self-help, New Age, and religious writers. &nbsp;No disrespect is meant. &nbsp;Nature is inherently inspirational and I just don't want anyone in this group to feel they are being subjected to evangelizing of any sort. &nbsp;If you organize a spiritual silent walking group (equally valid) let me know so that I can advertise it in this description for those who are interested.</p></hr> </html>

<p>I recently moved to Portland and while the city is lovely, I sometimes miss back home. I was in LA for 20 years and my bf splits time in PDX and NYC. We figure there are a few people here who have lived in LA and/or NYC for 10+ years... people into travel, food, visual arts, performing arts, books, science, media, over-booked calendars (the way we liked it), good conversationalists, and those jones-ing a little for the I'm-almost-burned-out-but-I-kinda-love-it feeling...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our MeetUps may be paired with a pre-First Thursday cocktail gathering or drinks at an eclectic lounge where we can hear each other chat (no dive bars and no beer only places). &nbsp;I'm open to places you would like to meet... message me.</p>

Learn music by ear -- no music reading required. We'll be singing mostly a capella, sometimes with instrumental accompaniment. The class is small enough to allow for individual attention. Part of the class is spent on one-on-one vocal coaching -- vowel color, support, everything a conventional singing lesson covers. The rest of the class is spent singing short arranged pieces, "tags", in 2-part, 3-part and 4-part harmony. Beginners sing a set part. Advanced singers will be guided in arranging and/or improvising their own harmonies. <br></p>
<p>The teacher, Paul Olguin, directs the Columbia River Chorus, co-directs the Bridgetown Sound chorus, and sings in two quartets, Coda and Hometown Harmony.

We don't charge dues or fees to members, we just want to stay in touch and help. Diets and workout plans are great but most people don't stick to them long enough to see results. It is also entirely possible to look great but not feel well. If you try to get healthier and have no supportive friends, it is likely that you will not reach your goals alone. HAP is different. We discover and share tips to integrate healthier habits into our busy lives so that our improvements are long-term. We come together to move, meditate, and motivate! We use Facebook, Google, and Meetup to proclaim our goals publicly, coordinate our gatherings, and track our progress. We don't judge members for not making their goals, we do affirm and further encourage those who do! Start your transformation today by joining this group and attending a group event. See you soon.</hr> </html>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Portland-Womens-Social-Friendship-Group-Ages-45-65">Portland Women's Friendship Group (Ages 45-65)</a></h2>for: <b>22</b> Women ages 45-65<br><p>From Our Original Fearless Leader Susan:</p>
<p>We are a small (limited to 12 or so attending at any one meeting so please watch the RSVP) group of mid to late-mid life women coming together every other week primarily for group discussion.  We are open-minded, open-hearted, progressive in our thinking. The intent of this group is to provide a space for women to share their accumulated wisdom, experiences, difficulties and laughter.  We can share our philosophies, psychological perspectives, our spiritual aspirations, and relationship hopes and dreams.  Ultimately, we hope to forge true friendships among individuals within the group.  We welcome those with good communication skills (both speaking and listening); a basic understanding of, and commitment to, group dynamics; and a willingness to participate with enthusiasm, respect and integrity. Our responsibility is to form a welcoming, safe space for each of us to feel we can express our authentic selves.</p>
<p>We will be meeting initially at a private home in inner SE Portland on Saturday afternoons from 4:30pm to 6:00pm. This was decided because the focus of the group is communication, rather than just socializing.  Being in a public place limits the depth of interaction between us.  As the group grows we may negotiate time and place though we would prefer to limit the place to the greater Portland area. We welcome those in outlying areas to come join us. If you choose, bring a snack or other food item to share. This is not required, but welcome.</p>
<p>My vision is that our time will be spent just socializing for the first half hour of the meeting.  The remaining hour will be devoted to intensive group discussion.  Please note that this is not just a social group.  My hope is, again, that our discussion will be personal, rather than topical.  My preference will be that we try to steer clear of labels, to avoid divisive topics such as politics.  This does not mean that we will not be willing to express our values and the issues they entail.  Everyone must be willing, when sharing an opinion, to hear others as well.  Tolerance and a non-judgmental attitude are essential characteristics of a successful group.  Many of us are much more comfortable with others who are in complete agreement with our preferences.  This is likely not to be the case in this group.  Please make a well-thought out choice before joining us.</p>
<p>We do not wish to exclude anyone. However, we are not a professional group capable of providing the level of support necessary to deal with those experiencing current, ongoing severe physical trauma, abuse, chemical dependency or mental health issues.</p></hr> </html>

<p>I didn't see any meetups with a magic focus, so I thought I'd see if anyone else was interested in learning about magic, practicing what they know, sharing tricks, helping others improve, etc.</p>
<p>My dad got me into magic at a young age, with animal balloons and a few card tricks. I've learned a few decent tricks with everyday items along the way and have just gotten back into magic recently. I've been practicing NFW and would be happy to practice it on you and to teach it along with some others. Two of my favorites since I was a kid are the invisible deck and the rising card. I'd like to learn some more as well as just have some fun with this group and people who have that common interest.</p>
<p>If we meet on weekends during day, bring your kid if you must. I might. He's 4.5.</p></hr> </html>

<p>Our events will be driven by the skill sets and interests of our members. If there's demand for basic "Introduction to OpenDaylight"-type events, we'll provide those. If people want to get some hands-on experience standing up and using OpenDaylight, we'll do that. If there's interest in taking a deeper dive into a feature of OpenDaylight, we can probably get the contributors who built that feature to join us, either remotely or in-person. If folks want help contributing to OpenDaylight, from improving a wiki to answering questions on ask.opendaylight.org to reporting bugs or writing code, we can get experienced community members to facilitate that process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much like OpenDaylight and other Open Source projects, this community strives to be an open meritocracy. Have an idea for an event? We can facilitate it! Have some OpenDaylight experiences to share with the community? Let's make it happen!</p>

Note, to be a member the dues are $5.00 annually to take care of the Meetup costs. &nbsp;Thanks for helping.</p></hr> </html>

They were all creative, interesting people and their work was awesome. As I stumbled around the 10 or so halls (rubbing elbows with 350,000 gaming fans and developers from around the world) I was blown away by the creativity involved in gaming. It's come a long way since I was glued to my 486 playing Kings Quest, Quest for Glory and Interplay's version of "The Lord of The Rings." Oregon is already on the map, let's keep the momentum going.

<p><b>KEEP IN MIND</b>: This is <strong>not</strong> a therapy group. The focus is on peer support. We do not diagnose, confirm nor dis-affirm diagnoses.&nbsp; At this time, we are only accepting those who have been diagnosed DID (DSM Code #300.14) by a qualified mental health professional and those who support them. &nbsp;We highly suggest that you have a strong network of support to assist in this journey of healing and acceptance.</p></hr> </html>

<p>A safe, secure environment is crucial to this group's success. In an effort to create a tight-knit community of like-minded parents and to ensure the safety of everyone involved, please note the following group requirements before requesting to join.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Membership dues are $5/year. This will offset the costs of the meetup (roughly $140/year) and encourage active participation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. &nbsp;Participation: members are asked to attend at least one meetup every three months. Maintaining an active roster will create a stronger community and encourage families to feel safe and secure in attending and hosting. New members are required to meet&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Profile requirements: a profile picture MUST show your recognizable face. It is important for us to be able to identify and recognize one another. It also creates a safe, comfortable environment when we can see and relate to one another.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Vaccinations: Due to the dangers posed to those too young or unable to receive &nbsp;their vaccinations, unvaccinated children are not welcome at group activities unless there is a medical reason, in which case it is the member's responsibility to inform the group.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This group is intended for anyone committed to peaceful parenting and raising mindful children, regardless of spiritual and religious affiliation, gender, age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, etcetera. All are welcome who are nonjudgmental, open minded, and kind. We welcome diversity of backgrounds and beliefs!&nbsp;</span></p>

<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/MoonlitPoetry">The Moonlit Poetry Caravan</a></h2>for: <b>13</b> Poets<br><p>The Moonlit Poetry Caravan is focused around a shared aesthetic, and a desire to grow as poets via constructive feedback. If you are looking for a poetry group, we may or may not be your cup of tea, and vice versa  and I say this in the spirit of respect for the variety of views that art includes and provokes.<br>

<br>

 Poets with significant experience in the arts are encouraged to press Apply, and to submit 4-6 poems as a sample via email to am@amolotkov.com. We are interested in all types of unrhymed poetry, with a preference for works that are not overtly narrative. We also lean towards work that does not make excessive use of specific place-names and name-names.<br>

<br>

 Currently the group meets on first and third Thursday of every month at 7:15pm at one of the poets homes. Hosting is not mandatory to be in the group.<br>

<br>

I would like to get a core group of people together who might be interested in catching a movie, play, event, or dinner as a group. There will be no pressure to be chatty or the life of the party; you won't even have to talk if you don't want to. Hopefully, after we have gone out as a group a few times we will feel comfortable having a conversation or not, it's up to the individual. I think that just being in the presence of others who care is something pretty powerful and I would like to make our group outings a regular event and based on the interest of the group as well. So, if you feel like you'd appreciate doing something social but without all of the pressure please consider this group. Thanks!</hr> </html>
