<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Portland">Girl Develop It Portland</a></h2>for: <b>633</b> Nerdettes<br>Women Developers and Programmers!
Want to learn how to code? Have a great idea? Don't be shy. Develop it.
It can be intimidating for women to learn and ask questions when they are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer community is up to 91% male. There isn't a comfortable place where women can learn at their own pace and not be afraid to ask "stupid questions."
We decided it was time to provide a place where all questions are OK and everyone can learn in a supportive environment. Our courses focus on coding, leveraging existing technology, and having something to show for it (aka building sweet websites).
Stay tuned to this meetup for upcoming scheduled classes.</hr> </html>
<html> <hr><h2><a href="http://meetup.com/PDX-Quantified-Self">PDX Quantified Self</a></h2>for: <b>501</b> Self Trackers in PDX<br><p><span>Quantified Self is a collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking.  You can learn more about this fast-growing, worldwide movement at http://quantifiedself.com .</span></p>
<p>Self-tracking covers a wide spectrum.  Some are working to improve their health and fitness by tracking weight, exercise, sleep, or nutrition.  Others want to gain insight into their emotions.  Still others aim to improve their productivity and effectiveness by measuring how they spend their time.</p>
<p>Our Portland group meetups follow the QS model -- a mix of short presentations, spontaneous discussions, and free-form networking.  You'll hear more personal stories and practical experiences than theoretical lectures, and demos are particularly enjoyable.  Anyone is welcome to speak - just email the organizer before the meeting.</p>
<p>Whether you're already on a technology-powered journey to self-improvement, or just curious about the concept, come join us!</p></hr> </html>

<p>This group was started by fundraising professionals who wanted to find a place to come together both online and in person to share tips and advice about our individual fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>Through online discussions and monthly meetings we hope to support fellow members of the group in their fundraising initiatives and learn ways to diversify our fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, this meetup is about helping people create community and learn about fundraising.</p>
<p>This meetup is not a place for people looking to get money from its members. This is a promotion-free zone. If you are a "network marketer" or want to tell people to donate to your campaign, please do not join this group. We are here for professional development only.</p>
<p>We will cover topics such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting more sponsors</li>
<li>Writing a better appeal letter</li>
<li>Donor stewardship strategies</li>
<li>Finding new donors</li>
<li>How to get people to open your e-newsletter</li>
<li>Crowdfunding</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nonprofit interview skills</li>
<li>Cover letter review</li>
<li>Salary negotiation techniques</li>
<li>Social media jobhunting techniques</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also look at different fundraising books, for example, Joyaux &amp; Ahern's Keep Your Donors, or The Accidental Fundraiser by Roth &amp; Ho.</p>
<p>We will invite guest speakers on major gifts, prospect research, capital campaigns, planned giving, etc, and ask community members to speak as well.</p>
<p>The Portland Professional Fundraiser and Grantmaker Meetup Group is for anyone currently working, studying, or transitioning into nonprofit fundraising and grantmaking positions.</p>
<p>We look forward to our members using this site organization to promote a global network of like-minded sites by individuals who will help each other to advance their professional education, provide mentoring, and strengthen their professional associations.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, we hold Portland Oregon-based networking events; encourage members to develop one-on-one professional contacts; and, provide professional development mentoring.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you soon!</p></hr> </html>
